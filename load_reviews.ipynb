of the best books in the series I think., I absolutely loved the entire HP series., Almost over. I don\\'t think i can handle the suspense of wondering what is going to happen., dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~ \\n The best of all the seven books, It only gets better as the suspense builds in this terrific, mysterious tale of possible double-crossing and virtuousness that delivers the best emotional mix of good versus evil on both a meta- and micro- scale since the Allies versus the Axis in the Second World War., ok but i miss dumbledore!!!! :(, Definitely the least bad of all the books. Two reasons: the youtube video, and the insane new adverbs she managed to come up with. Consolingly., series of my childhood!, First of all, Im in love with these books since I was 12 years old, and I got my first book for Christmas. I was hooked then, and I am still now, several years, books, movies and theme parks later. Once piece of me will always dream about this magical world, and Hogwarts will always be my home. \\n Having said that, this is my least favorite book. I enjoyed learning about Voldemort\\'s past, but it took way too much of the book and the school year and it wasn\\'t that much worth it. The other characters, Ron and Hermione, are flat and lack of any flavor; they just leave Harry alone and submerge themselves in a teen world filled of hormones. I really didn\\'t like how they suddenly, form one book to another, are so superficial and blind, and cant care less about Harry and Voldemort. To me it just doesn\\'t make any sense. \\n I cried a lot at the end of this book. I know this had to happen, but it still huts when I think about it. But I knew the true from the beginning, I knew it couldn\\'t be as Rowling was showing us and who was actually an allied in disguise. \\n If you are expecting a book full of action, this is definitively not it. But this need to happen in order to give room to the final book, the one that changes everything. I just hoped it could have been more fun to read., I forget how excellent this book is until I read it. My first time, I was up until 3am on a Saturday night finishing it and the ending just gutted me. It turned everything I believed about these characters upside-down on its head. For weeks... months... years, the debate raged: whose side is Snape really on? The book itself is terrific, a cracking good read. It moves fast. It brings in elements of adolescence in unique ways, but more importantly, it resonates with grief at the end. If you\\'ve ever lost someone, you\\'ll completely identify with Harry\\'s shock, horror, guilt, and ultimate feeling that the death was senseless and wasteful. That is the message Rowling imparts to her readers -- that every loss is devastating, but that unfortunately, death is a part of life... and it\\'s those who face it with courage who are the greatest heroes., Such a good book. I never saw the twist coming and I certainly will always cry over the loss of a good friend. Harry is such a typical, yet extraordinary, teenage boy and he certainly shows what it means to be brave., This book didn\\'t disappoint me at all. I absolutely love the charming aspect of this book and book series. It\\'s sad that this book series is almost over. I can\\'t get enough of it! 5 stars!, What an emotional roller coaster. Words can\\'t describe how I\\'m feeling right now., This book is on the bibliography of books challenged, restricted, removed or banned in 2007-2008 put out by Robert P. Doyle and the American Library Association. More info at http://www.ila.org/pdf/2008banned.pdf, A good book, but almost a place-marker--you get the feeling that it\\'s just moving time along until the climax in book 7., This book is my second favorite, but i still am loyal to OOTP and i am excitedly awaiting the final enstallment of this series., My wife and I were introduced to the Harry Potter series through playing the Harry Potter \"Scene-It\" game, which is a movie trivia game on interactive DVD, featuring scenes from the movies. \\n After our first game we immediately bought all of the books and each of the deluxe-edition DVD\\'s. \\n So far I\\'ve read every book outloud twice, so that my wife and I can enjoy them at the same time. \\n We also have the second Harry Potter \"Scene-It\"game with questions and movie scenes from the first five movies., Urgh., I can\\'t help but notice what a moody teenager Harry has become in this book. He seems to suffer from the same blindness to others as Dumbledore, only he doesn\\'t trust unlike his headmaster. I\\'m proud to say that I didn\\'t cry during this rereading, however my eyes did well up with tears. It bothers me that the ending feels so rushed. Harry goes through so much in one night. It\\'s almost as overwhelming for the reader. I can\\'t wait to read the last book of the series! \\n Reread it again because I went to the movie. I like to have the canon fresh in my mind. It was everything I remembered, and having read the last book, it was fun to look for hints of things to come. The more I read this series, the more I love it., Probably my favorite Harry Potter book so far., Pense que no iba a llorar, me la di de guapa e igualito solte un monton de lagrimas. \\n Dios mio! Este libro me encanto de principio a fin! Desde el primer capitulo estuve enganchada. Todo me encanto! \\n Creo que se ha convertido en mi favorito de la serie, de verdad se llevo todos los premios. \\n Ame a Voldemort como villano, me encanto ver su pasado y ver como manejaba a la gente a su antojo! Ame ver su historia y como llego a existir. \\n Dumbledore siempre estara en mi corazon! Siiiiempreeeee, e incluso, le tome cierta simpatia a Snape! \\n En definitiva, este libro fue un Felix Felicis para mi![?], Snape is the Half BLood Prince and that he killed Dumbledore., This book is just as amazing every single time I\\'ve read it. This time I was reading it to my brother (hence why it took so long) and he absolutely loved it., This one is now my favorite in the series., My second favourite out of them all. So sad, but so intriguing., These are getting so darn heavy. I knew the ending was coming because it was spoilered for me a week or so ago, but it still hit really hard., Reread December 2016 for Harry Christmas to You. This is another one that I\\'d forgotten pretty big parts of. If I had to pick a least favorite Harry Potter book, this would probably be it. It was a really interesting book, and there were certain small parts that I absolutely loved, but as a whole, it just didn\\'t quite measure up to my rereads of the rest. \\n Reread December 2014 for Harry Christmas to You., I know that I am about 87% behind the rest of the world in reading book 6 of the Harry Potter series. I am finally reading it... then maybe I will start to think about reading the final installment. Holding these hefty Harry Potter books on the train gives me carpal-tunnel syndrome.. my body can only take so much, people! \\n *********** \\n Done reading it! It was a quick 600+ pages to read. My favorite Harry Potter book since book 3., Dumbledore.... \\n Hermione is so salty. Ginny and Harry are cute af. Dobby vs. Creature. So annoying that Harry literally touched Ravenclaws diadem lol. Bad year for Quidditch players., I experienced so many emotions while reading this. I busted out laughing several times in quiet areas. And I cried like a baby through the last few chapters. I\\'m almost scared to start the next one., Series Review: \\n I think I\\'ll never tire of talking about Harry Potter. This remains true despite the fact that almost five years have passed since publication of the final book and almost a year (!) since the final movie. I daresay I\\'m not alone. This is evident by the popularity of fansites like The Leaky Cauldron, official sites like Pottermore, and attractions like the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter. The story of the boy wizard resonated with so many of us, both young and old, that he and his friends will live on in our hearts forever. [See more at http://cellardoorians.com/why-harry-p...], Read in English and Danish., My only issue with this is that Harry really started turning into an angsty teen (or was it the one before?) It did get annoying, the way he treated everyone and wanted to be the sole hero, but hey, he\\'s 16., who dosnt love harry potter?? well not me....., It took me a few days to finish it off, since I had to read it a few bits at a time, but as of tonight I\\'ve also finished Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. An erratic read for me, all in all. It had a good strong start for me, a middle that was frequently leaden and seemingly pointless, and an ending that, on the heels of the aforementioned leaden middle, was robbed of some of the darkness and grit it should have maintained. \\n Which is not to say I didn\\'t like the darkness and grit of this ending--because oh my yes, it was quite effective. And I\\'ll cheerfully say that the final funeral bit did bring active tears to my eyes, and any book that can do that gets extra points. The ending, also, was a decent enough followup to the good stuff at the beginning. But that middle stretch... guh. A lot of it read for me as if Ms. Rowling suddenly found herself realizing holy crap the series is almost done Lassie\\'s still in the well and I haven\\'t paired everybody off yet AIGH! \\n Don\\'t get me wrong--I don\\'t mind that a lot of pairings get set up in this book, on general principle. And with the main younger members of the cast getting old enough that they\\'re starting to get interested in such things, it\\'s totally plausible. But my gold standard for \"high school romance\"--which this essentially is, even if it\\'s in a magical setting--is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and hey, what can I say, ol\\' Joss brought a lot more Funny to the whole thing. And, more importantly, integrated it better into the overall plot. In this particular book, especially in regards to Harry, it felt forced. \\n In fairness though I shall also say that there are very good points to this book: backstory on Voldemort makes it worth the time spent for the reading all by itself. Watching the older Harry and Ron and Hermione react to younger students is occasionally quite snicker-worthy. The most notable of the older-character romances that crops up actually interests me enough that I wouldn\\'t mind seeing decent fic on that, just because I like the characters involved. (The other older-character romance, the one that drives everyone batshit, also was kind of fun but for different reasons--I like how the tension there finally got resolved.) And, for the first time in the entire series, Draco actually, finally got interesting. ;) \\n All in all, though, I find this the most uneven of the series. Two and a half stars., I literally have no words. I feel like half the blood left my heart. I\\'m devastated., Fourth reread: September 4, 2016- September 9, 2016 \\n This book was a much more fun read than OotP for me (at least this time around). The pensieve scenes involving Tom Riddle have always been a favorite of mine; I love to return to them, especially since they are never fully realized in the films. The last 100 pages were incredibly sad to me and very difficult to get through. I was surprised by how easily I was able to get through Sirius\\'s death in OOtP, but how heartbreaking it was to read this book\\'s final act. Dumbledore\\'s death was especially painful this time. I\\'m not sure why, but the fact that I enjoyed this book more (and didn\\'t want it to end) might have played a role. I was anxious to get done with OOtP. \\n Really love this book; a great final year at Hogwarts. Like 2011, I am excited to read DH, but also don\\'t want my reread to end., I think we can all agree that the basics are all the same in this series. You can\\'t arrive at your review of the sixth book and pretend that you\\'ll be saying anything new about the writing, world building, characters and development, plot progression and execution, etc. As always, all of these elements are impeccable in this sixth and second-to-last installment. \\n I enjoyed it a bit more than the last one because our teenagers are feeling a little less angsty and are just about on the brink of adulthood. Well, Hermione and Ron, by wizarding standards, have or will have come of age during or shortly after this book, having turned 17. Harry will follow, of course, in July of the seventh book, which is usually where our books pick up. We have some added romance by way of Ron and Lavender... uh.. and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny. I don\\'t particularly think romance is a strong suit for Rowling - she really is a genius by way of mystery and fantasy, but I didn\\'t completely buy the Harry-Ginny thing. I\\'ve always felt a bit like that and I really made an effort to connect with them a bit more this time to see if I was maybe missing something, but I feel like I only made a small bit of progress. I like the idea of it, of favorite characters in a favorite series being together. I just didn\\'t like the execution and didn\\'t really feel much of the chemistry with them. \\n I\\'ve never really felt that way about Hermione and Ron because their feelings for eachother are hinted at earlier on in the series and its easy to accept what you\\'ve been hoping for all that time. However, I did realize that I didn\\'t feel much in the way of chemistry on that front either, but like I said, it just is... meant to be... so it didn\\'t really bug me. \\n The ending of this book still shocks me to the core no matter how many times I\\'ve read it or watched it play out on the big screen. I just hate it, though I know it serves a much bigger purpose. I tried hard to study Snape and his actions and dialogue, because really, we all know what happens, but I\\'d just like to understand it better. Something I\\'ve never understood, even from book one, was Snape\\'s rage and hatred toward Harry... or well, anyone who isn\\'t like Snape himself, I guess. I get the whole thing with his dad and the friends, but come on. Aren\\'t we all grown ups here? Well, again, I know it all serves a higher purpose, but its something I could never quite come to terms with. I can understand being cold and detached, but there were times throughout the series that Snape was downright cruel and even in this book, knowing what we know about book 7... I guess I won\\'t go getting all spoilery for the random person living under a rock who hasn\\'t read the book. \\n There isn\\'t much else to say about this book other than how much I loved it and truly enjoyed it deep down in my bones. I\\'ve only read the last two books once before so I loved going through it all again, being able to study the parts that once confused me and really see deeper into the books. Though it was heartwrenching, it was enchanting and wonderfully done and I think it did the series justice. \\n Its still going to take some time for me to figure out how I feel about it in reference to the other books. Definitely more toward the top of the list and there are only 7, so its not like they can all be my favorite., Re-reading in movie anticipation :), Love this series! Couldn\\'t put the books down. I read the first book after seeing the first movie and was instantly hooked. Now I can\\'t help but read them over and over., One of my favorites of the series., Very funny, great book. First time that you start to view the kids as young adults, Je to neco mezi 4 a 5 hvezdickami. Nemohl jsem se do toho poradne zacist, jako do predchoziho dilu. Moc se toho vlastne v knize nestalo, jen takovy predvoj sedmicky., So amazing that there is no justifiable description to express its unbelievableness, ** spoiler alert ** \\n This was my second time through Half-Blood Prince. \\n Really... Is there any better writer appealing simultaneously to children *and* adults than J.K. Rowling?! \\n I read the book again to gear-up for the release of the sixth movie this November and I loved in on a whole new level. By now, the reading public (including every school-age kid who cares one hint about Harry Potter) are all aware that Rowling kills off Harry\\'s mentor, Hogwart\\'s headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. \\n What amazes me most is *knowing* how this book ends, and journeying through it a second time with even more anticipation of the story\\'s conclusion. Rowling\\'s authorship is masterful. Her ability to hide truths from her readers in plain view, leaving you to ask at the conclusion of the story \"How couldn\\'t I see this coming?!\", is brilliant and unmatched! \\n There are those these books do not appeal to. To the millions already hooked, you don\\'t need any prompting to read these jewels over again., One of my favorites out of the series! It was so interesting to see how the characters have matured into teenagers., \"And Harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated. . . .\", This is a page turner with plot twists galore., Not Dumbledore..., Re-read this book in 2007 in anticipation of the final book., LOVED =], This ended up being my favorite book! I was completely enthralled from page one. There is SO MUCH that is not in the movie. I loved it!!, Loved it, The worst of the series! Lacked the usual originality that kept me devouring the previous novels. And depressing to boot., One of my favorite books in the series. That ending still hits me hard.. so heartbreaking, Re-reading this book for the (well let\\'s just say I\\'ve read this one a lot) is still amazing. You just can\\'t beat Harry Potter., I think this might have been my favorite out of the Harry Potter Series. I don\\'t think I need to explain plot or subject matter, but I do have this to say. JK Rowling\\'s Harry Potter books climb into your heart. Not so much because her writing is exquisite or her ideas are brand new. It\\'s because this woman has the magical ability that only some authors have to bring her characters out of a book, off a page, and into your life. Every single one of the people she\\'s written about, for me and for many others I know, became real entities, people we knew, people we loved and people we cared about. The Half-Blood prince deepened those feelings for me. \\n I could climb onto a high horse and judge too harshly, pick apart certain simplicities in plot, or just generally be bitter and jealous, but how can I? I loved Harry Potter, especially The Half-Blood Prince, and it is my wish as an author to write something one day that means even a smidgen to people\\'s hearts that this series did. \\n Long live Ravenclaw! I mean...Gryffindor! Aw, heck! Long live Hogwarts!, This time on audio. This line seemed particularly cogent... \\n \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\", ** spoiler alert ** \\n Not my favorite of the series, especially since Dumbledore died, but of course I loved it because I love all the Harry Potter books., I am devastated after this book. Definetly cried., Death is truly brought as a forefront in this book, making the whole series no longer PG-rated. Harry dives into extracurriculars including planning the death of the Dark Lord and following around other students in suspicion. As Harry becomes himself more questionable, his story takes an even deeper plunge into the library of the memorable - This book is one of my favorite in the series., Did the audio version of this one. If I had not, I would still be reading it at Christmas. I am finally getting around to finishing this series, and i think audio is the way to go...as she sometimes includes really thick chapters about things that don;t require that much paper. But nonetheless, it\\'s easier to get through when she does it than most writers., This book seemed to be much more well-paced than the previous two. I enjoyed it a lot, and noticed a certain depth to it that the rest of preceding books lack. I think it may be the fact that Dumbledore plays a much larger roll. I also think that Rowling\\'s writing has improved with each book. \\n On to the last book of my Harry Potter re-read-through!, I have just finished reading this installment again and find it one of the saddest. It\\'s not easy to say much as I don\\'t give spoilers but it is jammed packed full of action, adventure, magic and revelations, and we know for sure what is going to happen in book seven. \\n There are also favourite parts in this - the \\'lucky potion\\' and Ginny. I loved how those plots played out. \\n Overall, a brilliant fantasy. \\n Highly recommended., a bucketful of tears and a grin (because of the next generation of kids going into Hogwarts). \\n That\\'s how i ended reading this series this year. \\n <3, whenever my life gets really rough and I need a quick getaway, i pick one of the hp books. My apartment was flooded and I was ill for a month, and I was generally in a very shitty place... Couldn\\'t escape from the spiraling tension, multiple nervous breakdowns... my heart was beating too fast even while i was asleep... So one day, without being able to think about anything else but my problems, (or even concentrating on a book, movie...) i decided it was harry potter time. I read only the first chapter and my life was already better. I was able to fall asleep and even dream... That\\'s why these books are so great. They grab your attention so hard that no matter what situation you are in, you can\\'t help yourself but feel better. So if i may suggest something, whenever you\\'re down, just read your favourite book. Even better, read harry potter., I first tried reading it as a e-book but wasn\\'t able to go beyond 130 pages then read it on paperback. I remember it as an account where Holcrux was found and supposed to be destroyed and where Harry and Ginny fall in love. It is not THAT exciting but yes continues on the track., Excellent. Always love JK Rowling., I knew what was going to happen because I saw the movie, but that in no way prepared me for it while reading. Even though I know that he\\'s not coming back, I\\'m holding on to a world where he never dies. He just lives forever., Rowling\\'s writing has improved since Book 1, but this book disappointed me. No new interesting characters and depressing ending. Too much adolescent romance. But still a good read!, At the end of the series, everything became much more serious. The magic disappeared, and I missed that., This was the pivitol book, Favorite out of all of them!, I\\'ve been rereading this series over the last few months and wow, if they don\\'t just get better and better. One thing I\\'m noticing in this read-through is how much character development has really occurred over the last six books. Things are familiar (Quidditch, classes, the stress of Voldemort\\'s return), but are not repetitive. Rowling is so good at keeping things fresh & interesting. So many great moments. Mrs. Weasley and Fleur. Harry and Ginny. Harry and Dumbledore. Arnold the Pygmy Puff was just super cute and fun. I loved it. I remember being obsessed with reading the Mugglenet forums after this book came out re: whose side is Snape really on? That was a fun time. Can\\'t wait to dive into the last book!, So affecting, spawning so many theories (mine was half right). I have this in two versions: the UK/Canada version, and the US version., I really liked this one! Was my favorite till #7, The only thing that I hated in this book is he veeeery \"bitin\" ending and the death of a very important wizard in Harry\\'s life., 6th book in the series, and storywise probably the most revealing and important book. You can really see a difference in Rowling\\'s writing ability between the 1st and the 6th book. With this book the series continues to darken in mood and feels more like an adult suspense book at times than a childrens book., Just finished re-reading this in preparation for the last one. It was as good as the first time., Everyone has read harry potter! You know how good it is!, Book 6 was definately a head spinner! I was a little shocked that the tone of the books changed so drastically in this one. But it was a good shock. I certainly cried when Dumbeldore *you know what* but the blossoming relationships and the overall plot were great!, Not my favorite. It seems to be an aside from the main story arc of the series., Unpredictable! Harry Potter and the half-blood prince will make you figure out the puzzle., Reread in December 2014 for #HarryXmasToYou \\n I loved rereading this book. I always forget how different it is from the movie! SO GOOOOOOD!, Another great Harry Potter--the reason they all have four stars is that though I believe Rowling is an amazing story teller, she could have tightened the writing a little bit., Still my favorite in the series! Just finished listening to the audio version. Jim Dale is amazing., I\\'m tired and too lazy to type up a full review... But I\\'ll say a few things. \\n This book was clearly amazing. Maybe there was a humongous bunch of backstory and wizarding concepts and stuff like that, but I could manage it. I actually liked it though; it wasn\\'t stupid adventures centering around Harry Potter. It gave us a sense of how Lord Voldemort actually feels, and that he has a backstory and isn\\'t just a spirit of evil. He has emotions and stuff. \\n And the emotions were just written so well... A certain tragedy in the end sent me into tears. Literally. But I\\'m a tough girl and I shouldn\\'t be crying in front of my sister. But still, it was so sad... \\n And there was really good suspense! I was like \"Who\\'s this freaking Half-Blood Prince?\" the whole way, and that\\'s partially what kept me reading (also that the action was building up). \\n Finally, I absolutely appreciated the length of this book. After The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix , both which took FOREVER to finish, I can give myself a break with a much shorter book. Thank goodness! \\n But I\\'ve heard that the last book is loooong... Shit..., Radical, It felt like there were YEARS between the 5th book and this one, not just in release dates. Harry matured beyond what I ever expected him to. Brilliant use of \"flashbacks!\", Wish it was longer, Book 6 is probably my least favorite of the series, likely because it seems like filler between Harry\\'s spent childhood and the adventures to begin in the finale. Of course, this is necesary filler, as it gives insight to the character of Voldemort/Tom. Though Tommy-boy was obviously a sadist through and through, I loved learning about his poor mother. Most Slytherins do not redeem themselves, yet Book 6 also introduced the idea that Regulus, the Purebloodist younger brother of Sirius, ultimately turned his back on Voldie\\'s master plan and sacrificed his life in order to defeat him. \\n This is also a heavy Snape book, and he\\'s one of my favorite characters. His character certainly wasn\\'t the most pleasant to deal with in this book, but it sets up a better understanding of him in the finale., Makin dewasa, makin mencekam dan makin gelap. So, benar ga ini sesuai untuk anak2?, No words, just love., Loved it! I liked that Snape had loving feelings Harry\\'s mother, This book is so good. I remember reading it for the first time (how I wish I could have that experience again!) and just feeling my brain buzzing with the delight and excitement of finally putting the events of the previous books into their true context. Now, reading it again for the upteenth time, it has lost none of its charm and intensity. I know I\\'ll be reading it again many more times! \\n Severus Snape. Best character ever written. \\n Seriously, if you haven\\'t read this series, you are depriving yourself of one of the most magical experiences of your literary life., , Story of Harry as he enters his 6th year of Hogwarts. His adventures with a mysterious textbook, new revelations about Death Eaters and Voldemort and trying to discover who the Half-Blood Prince is. \\n Wow. I just finished it and I still keep thinking about it. Probably my favorite one so far based on the fact that I certainly did not see the end coming and I think there\\'s a pretty great setup for the final book. Lots of things change in this book which is pretty cool. Amazingly enough, this series just keeps getting better. And I\\'m over thirty., This was definitely my favorite of the series. Light and fun, it is by far the more humorous. Chalk full of relationship awkwardness that it oh so common to adolescence, there are some great sections in this book that will make you laugh out loud. Of course there is also the traditional struggle against evil as well!, I finished my #hpchapteraday reading for book 6 a little early because the story was too intense to quit after just one chapter. Haha Once again, so glad I finally chose to read this series. Such good books. Looking forward to starting book 7 in just a few days., reread finished; May 25, 2017 \\n Oh... awal dari akhir petualang kita yang panjang!! \\n Meski tampak seperti semua mulai menemukan cintanya (ya ampun... cinta.. Harry dan kawan-kawan, mereka benar-benar sudah bertambah besar ya??!! sudah bukan anak-anak lagi mereka sekarang.) yah, meski demikian, kesedihan besar menanti. Walau bagaimanapun, semenyenangkan apapun, petualang panjang ini tetap akan mencapai ujung ceritanya., Love this book. Great set up for the finale., Huhu. namatay si Dumbledore., Never trust a deatheater!, Just rip out my heart and stomp on it., 1st read: Nov 2005 \\n 2nd read (aloud): Jun 20, 2014 - Jul 20, 2014, In the this, the sixth book in the Harry Potter series, Rowling continues to ramp up the stakes. She expertly interweaves a number of plot threads, leading up to the tragic climatic finish. Snape has finally got his wish and has been appointed Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Draco Malfoy has been given a deadly mission by Voldemort, Harry is for the first time ever excelling at potions with the help of the Half-Blood Prince\\'s notes and Dumbledore has revealed to Harry the secret of Voldemort\\'s survival and begun training him for the final encounter. \\n The Half Blood Prince was a great read in its own right while leaving me keen to read the last of the series., [?], By far the best of the series , Harry has become a man, Unbelievable. I was on edge almost the whole book. It\\'s shocking, it\\'s sad, it\\'s unbelievable. J. K. Rowling has outdone herself yet again., This is the sixth book in the H.P. series and although I liked 5 better, it is still a really great book, A little shocking and depressing in the end but still one of the best books I\\'ve ever read!, Brilliant, It\\'s Harry Potter, need I say more? Love the wonderful world of Potter!, I love re-listening to these. It\\'s like coming home after being away far far too long., A defiant must read. So much better than the movie. Details so much better., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I\\'ve been a fan of the movies for years and am just getting around to reading the books. The death of Dumbledore is so much more devastating in print. The emotion roller coaster of this series in like non other. I see what children lined up to buy these books on their release dates. \\n After reading just the first book I\\'ve become more of a Potterhead then ever before., Naturally, I re-read this in honor of the film\\'s release, albeit slightly late. I ended up, somehow, at my first midnight film screening for this go-round--it was tamer than expected, and wonderful, but in any case, I had just begun re-reading the book that day, so didn\\'t have time to finish before seeing the movie. I recognize that many people consider the sixth book/movie as a mere bridge between the rest of the series and the final book, I really do count this one as one of my very favorites of the series. There are two things that prove endlessly fascinating to me about this book--two things which set it apart from the rest of the series. The first is that we\\'re given a rare glimpse into the pre-Voldemort Voldemort (e.g. Tom Riddle)--which is such a mature move on Rowling\\'s part, in my opinion, because Voldemort becomes a more fully realized character, rather than a simple one dimensional sketch of evil incarnated. Secondly, we *finally* see Harry and Dumbledore\\'s relationship flourish and create a sense of intimacy and power for the reader--not in an erotic way, though it probably sounds that way with the phrasing I\\'m using--but in a way that makes us privy to why Dumbledore is so intrigued by Harry, why he places so much blind trust in certain figures, where he makes his mistakes and how incredibly human he can be. Those two facets alone are worth the entry fee. Then of course the ending, and the many lovely and suspenseful moments throughout the novel--among them, Harry\\'s fight with Draco, the development of Harry\\'s interest in Ginny, Slughorn\\'s guilt, and so forth. Was such a fun, fun re-read. I want to do Deathly Hallows again now, but I\\'ve got so many books to read to get ready for the semester, so it might just need to wait (and I want to return to Pullman\\'s His Dark Materials series, too!)., Fantasy must be for real..., This is my favorite of the first six books. I loved it, though the end was so sad., the best written climax of all harry potter books. \\n **11/20/14** Finished the audio version. This is such a heartbreaking climax! Still my favorite. There are some thinly veiled attempts to connect the Tom Riddle legacy to the Chamber of Secrets even though it\\'s obvious that in Book 2, the lore hadn\\'t quite been hashed out by J.K. Rowling yet. However, this gets so much better when the characters leave their brooding behind... \\n Can\\'t wait to start listening to the final book... \"The diary, the ring, the locket, the cup, the snake, something of Ravenclaw\\'s or Gryffindor\\'s.\", Death Eaters break in \\n To once-peaceful Hogwarts school \\n Snape kills Dumbledore, La historia de voldemort es mas interesante que la de Harry., I have yet to read the 7th book and I know the 8th is soon to be released; but this was by far the best HP book yet. Why I waited so long to read these books I don\\'t even know., Excelent!!! was one of my favorite that saga..., Not as good as I was hoping. Still a good read, I liked reading the Harry potter saga, but this book was not one of the best. It is as entertaining as the previous ones, but it lacks originality, and it is quite similar to all the others., Clearly Devastated after that ending., Great!, Saddest book in the series so far., If there were more stars available, I would give this book a lot more than 5 stars. Amazingly written, so much wisdom hidden in every page. More powerful than a simple children\\'s book., 4.5/5. Muchas personas dicen que es el mejor de la saga pero a mi, sinceramente, me costo un poco conectar en ciertas partes porque tuve unos momentos de fatiga mientras leia pero no pude parar asi que fue como raro. Tambien creo que fue por la mala traduccion que me toco leer porque soy una pobre venezolana que obviamente no tiene y no encuentra este libro. Eso no implica que haya sido excelente, pero como que en momentos perdi demasiada concentracion comno para dar la talla de esta lectura, pero bueno, es complicado. \\n Siento que no hago justicia con estas resenas, pero tal vez al final, con el ultimo me ponga las pilas, asi como hice con todos los libros de HOO y haga una resena general en el ultimo. \\n El final no me hizo tanto dano como el del libro anterior pero casi me hace llorar y me dejo con poquito de dolor, pero eso no me va a impedir empezar el proximo. Y sobre Snape, que veo que mucha gente lo adora y lo excusa, no tengo ni idea de lo que sigue en el ultimo libro pero no creo que eso vaya a hacer que mi opinion sobre ese ser tan desagradable cambie. \\n Gracias por leer otra cosa sin sentido, si alguien quiere hablar de Harry Potter para drenar mis sentimientos, le agradecere mucho., Go Slytherin !, Despite the narrator, I liked the re-read a lot better than I did the first time I read this book., This book and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows are my two favourites from the series. I remember getting this book on the midnight release and reading it consistently for 48 hours (with no sleep, no food, and no getting up from my chair!) I would re-read them again and again (if I had the time!). An absolute must-read for everyone, at least once in your life., Just put everything on hold cause this book just ripped me apart!! No words..., No hay que pueda decir que le haga justicia a lo que los libros de HP me provocan. Me encanta que sean tan faciles de leer, de imaginar los escenarios, que me tengan con los ojos pegados al libro hasta que lo termino. \\n Estoy ansiosa por poder seguir leyendo la saga :), great ending...I finished a while ago for got to update, it is the one I have been avoiding to read.. as I know the death of Dumbledore will happen.. A master piece and an excellent ground work for the finale., Ketegangan di buku ini naiknya pelan-pelan dan diselingi \\'kisah-kisah\\' cinta dari Ron-Lanveder plus Ginny-Dean, cemburu-cemburuannya Hermione, Harry yang kebingungan dengan perasaan yang tiba-tiba muncul sama Ginny. \\n Di awal tahun ajaran ini, Dumbledore datang langsung ke rumah Paman Vernon untuk jemput Harry kembali ke Hogwarts. Di tengah jalan, sempet mampir ke rumah salah satu mantan guru Potion, Slughorn. \\n Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince menyisakan satu teka-teki lagi, siapakah seseorang berinisial R.A.B, yang mengaku sudah menemukan Horcrux?, i cannot believe dumbledore died . first sirius now him . this sucks and i know there will be more deaths coming but i just cant help it . . why ? \\n this book was good no doubt the story line and everything but why dumbledore i could have waited till the last book you know *sobs* \\n now harry is completely alone no one to look after him *sobs again*, I am speechless!! a bit sad now that it has ended, am quite excited though for the last book, and I can\\'t wait to track down those damned horcruxes and see what Lord Voldemort is really capable of., Love this book. Harry Potter is a fun series., But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world. \\n 11/1/2016: My favorite book in the entire series.. I still cry toward the end., The ending of this made me SO angry! \\n I hated what seemed like FOREVER of Ron and Hermione hating each other. Though I totally cheered when Hermi sent her birds after him. Serves him right. Jerk. \\n But it ended with them happily together, of course. \\n But the ending...! Dumbledore! Waa! Snape! Poor Draco!, Such an amazing story. and knowing the end doesn\\'t spoil anything! it\\'s the mark of a truly great series, This is my favourite volume of HP saga. We start seeing enemies who didn\\'t exist as for now and most of all we discover the future of Lord Voldemort. A true page-turning masterpiece and in my point of view the darkest book of the whole saga, Must -- reread -- before -- the movie -- comes out! \\n Here\\'s the thing: I read this once to myself, once out loud to the family, listened to the audio, and am now re-reading before going to see the movie. Despite knowing everything that is going to happen, all the secrets and twists, this is so enjoyable! I\\'m as riveted as ever., I never thought that I would like to read a Harry Potter book. But after seeing that last movie, I wanted to know what happened next. Too bad for me though, I succumbed to the temptation of reading the book and now I have spoiled the next movie for myself. I burst the bubble of surprise, and I know that most everyone knows what I am talking about, but just in case for those who don\\'t, I will change the subject. \\n In any event, I did really find the book to be a terrific read. I liked the hidden nature of book\\'s namesake and I of course love the characters. \\n One thing I did learn was not to go out and buy the last book. I really want to see it first and read the book later. I really want to enjoy the sensation as long as I can. I know that there are countless JKR minions who know not the prolonging of the pleasure. For them, the quest has ended, the story has been told. But for me, I\\'d rather savor it and enjoy it a little while longer. \\n I know. I\\'m a geek like that., I think this may become my second favorite in the series. PoA will, forever I think, be my number one. \\n Some will call this one a bad remake of CoS but I completely disagree. First, because obviously Harry needs to use all of his previous adventures, all of his experience now that he is getting closer and closer to the final encounter with Voldemort. Second, because the HBP\\'s book had nothing to do with Riddle\\'s diary... It wasn\\'t alive and never answered back, nor was it a piece of a random soul. The book was just that, a book, well Snape\\'s book which explains why Harry became a genius in Potions all over sudden. \\n There was a lot of romance... well, more likely snogging. Ron finally got some action and so did Harry. True it was a little bit cheesy at times, especially when it came to Ron and Hermione trying to attract each other\\'s attention and making the other one jealous, but then isn\\'t teenage romance always a bit cheesy? I was a bit surprised by the pairing Harry/Ginny... it came as quite unexpected to me but then I think Harry felt the same way. I also didn\\'t think he broke up with her for the right reasons. Let\\'s face it, now that the Death Eaters have got Draco on their side, Ginny will be in danger whether or not, she\\'s going out with Harry. Perhaps, Rowling is using that as an excuse so that in book 7, Hermione will become the leading female character again. \\n Draco... I must admit I really like the way Rowling portrayed him in this book. Long gone is the simplistic evil bully. Here, Draco\\'s grown up and showed a conscience, a strategic mind and determination. I found it funny that of all the people he\\'s surrounded with, the only he thought safe to confide in was Moaning Myrtle... this further uncovers this fake image of himself he\\'s trying to put up. \\n The HBP was, according to the title, supposed to be the main plot element; however, there are times when it is completely forgotten by the reader. In the end though, when looking back on the entire book, Rowling did give a much major role to Snape. I\\'m an active believer in the theory that Dumbledore didn\\'t not as much beg Snape to spare him (I could never imagine Dumbledore begging even less if he knew that Harry was around) than begging for Snape to kill him. They are both accomplished Legilimens after all and they didn\\'t break eye contact until Snape cursed Dumbledore. However, I felt more than ready to know what it was that Dumbledore knew about Snape that made him trust him so. However, Dumbledore\\'s sacrifice saved both Harry and Draco in the end, making the whole experience less definitive for the latter. \\n The fact that Dumbledore wanted to give private lessons to Harry at the beginning of the year kinda tipped me off. It meant that Dumbledore no longer thought that he was invincible, especially when he asked Harry his opinion. It kinda of deprived him of his untouchable image and prepared the reader for what was to come. That exactly make the pill easier to swallow but now that look back on it, I see the link. \\n RAB... um, my best guess would obviously be Regulus Black, Sirius\\' brother. That would probably explain why he was killed but it also lift the question: did Regulus destroy others of Voldemort\\'s horcruxes. \\n One of the main criticism that I would make would be the total disappearance of characters that had become important in the OoTP... I desperately wanted to see more Lupin, Luna and Neville. Speaking of Lupin... the pairing with Tonks more than surprised me... he hardly seemed convinced by it himself lol! \\n Overall, I disagree with those who claim that this volume was much darker than the previous one, I found it lighter (in all sense of the term!), like it was Harry\\'s last fun days before the big stuff got in the way. That\\'s probably one of the reasons why Ginny\\'s character withdraws at the end of the book. There won\\'t much time left for romance in the seventh book... well Ron and Hermione maybe cuz they still really have a long way to go., This is probably my least favourite of the Harry Potter series. While it had more technical skill than the previous installment, in my opinion, the tone of the thing was just so different from the other books. What I remember most about it was the romances that abound, not the magic or the mystery., This is only the second book I have shed a tear over. It is the most absolutely heart wrenching of the series (so far). I just can\\'t believe everything that happened and how much of a serious turn this book took from the previous ones. I just...I just can\\'t. \\n \"He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him.\", This was so good. so good. I love Harry Potter. I\\'m sad I have only one book left to finish, and yet so excited to see how everything unfolds. Love Harry Potter. Love. (I guess I am still kind of speechless.), This book is obviously meant to setup for the final book of the series. In this, the stakes get set higher and higher until the infallible fail. Potter learns that good and bad are not clearly drawn lines. He learns that the villainous are truly weak, ruled by fear. He learns to overcome that fear, although much of what he does so far is in terms of anger (and not love, as Dumbledore claims). So this book really just feels like one long approaching climax, without a resolution. \\n Still it\\'s easy to read, although much of the book consists of everyone being confused as to what is going on -- except Harry Potter and Dumbledore. \\n Maybe I will revise this review after I read the final book., Though I like the complete series but this one is one of the best., there\\'s been points during all of the harry potter books so far that i\\'ve gotten bored with the redundancy but this one definately make up for it. i\\'m officially hooked., A transition book... basically a set up for the vastly superior seventh book. However, it is still enjoyable, Of all the books in the series so far, this is by far the one with the unhappiest, and least satisfying, ending. It seems to me that it is in fact the first half of a two-book arc rather than a closed tale in itself, which is not in any way uncommon in fantasy fiction, but took me slightly by surprise in this series because the other novels have been so self-contained. \\n Spoilers ahead for the two or three people on the planet who have not yet read the books/seen the films/absorbed the gist from the general cultural soup. The biggest surprise to me in this novel was the death of Dumbledore, not because I wasn\\'t expecting it (if ever there were a sacrificial king-figure set up to be replaced by the younger, stronger king, it is he), but because I was expecting it in the last book, not here. I was therefore slightly stunned and spent the fairly lengthy denouement of the story vaguely hoping that there would be some magical resurrection. I rather admire Rowling for not falling into that temptation. Dumbledore is not Aslan, Christ or Gandalf, it seems. \\n That Snape is a double agent being set up for redemption in the last book seemed to me also reasonably clear as I was reading this volume. That being the case, it was necessary to give him some very pressing reason to commit the ultimate treason - the murder of his leader - and that reason was the preservation of the nasty child (but still a child) Draco Malfoy from the consequences of being forced into that same act. I would have been happier if we had seen Snape make his irremediable vow to Dumbledore himself, rather than to Draco\\'s mother. However, introducing the \"mother\\'s protective love\" element resonates with Harry\\'s story, I suppose. \\n Unusually, I found the unfolding of this novel a bit clunky - the long flashbacks to Voldemort\\'s past seemed very expository. Perhaps this is because I was not terribly interested in having Voldemort\\'s character fleshed out, preferring to have him as a featureless monster. I know for a fact that my other complaint of tedium is entirely my own bias: I am simply not interested in angsty teenage romance, which drives much of the Harry, Hermione and Ron part of the plot. The obligatory new professor (this time a pompous social climber named Slugworth) wasn\\'t terribly memorable, either - but at least he wasn\\'t Dolores! \\n All that said, tedium here is a relative concept. I still found this novel a page-turner, and I liked the nice clear metaphysical problem laid out (the soul divided in seven, each part enclosed in an object to be destroyed, the last object being Voldemort himself). The fact that that particular task is not completed by the end of the novel was enough to drive me forward quickly into the last instalment., Surely I loved this one, but was also a bit disappointed as I expected something different to happen :( \\n As I am re-reading (in audio format) in a short period of time all the Harry Potter books, I\\'ve realised that despite this one still being quite good it\\'s also, in my opinion, the weakest of the series. \\n There is very little action and it\\'s mostly a volume to dump a lot of information on Voldemort and also to raise the expectations for the last and 7th volume., The best one so far!!! My heart :(((, Keeps you on the edge of your seat!, A wonderful book, with a cliff-hanger at the end. Is Dumbledore really dead? Since these books are increasingly more mature I\\'d recommend this book to mature YA\\'s and adults only., Still reading a bit each night with my son, this was by far my favorite book yet! So much happiness in this book; Harry finds out what his future entails, he suffers through a devastating loss, he confirms that some of his suspicions were accurate and he even gets to experiences some romance too! I personally didn\\'t love any of the books until this one. This particular installment really had everything. I was completely sucked into the Dr\\'s \\n (especially the last half), the romance aspects for realistic and brought back lots of memories. I even laughed out loud several times. This book is action-packed, leaving me very eager for the grand finale!, Excellent book. On to the next one, This is one of the best books I have ever read. It has amazing parallels of good vs evil and OH MY GOSH! It\\'s my favorite book in the series so far. Dumbledore by far is the most noble man I have ever heard about... The way he carried himself, expressed himself, and loved others has resonated with my heart so deeply! He was an amazing man, and I cried with tears of sorrow when he died. He made this book beautiful. Harry Potter quite proved himself in this book as well. He has shown that he will fight the battle against Voldemort sacrificing the prospects of love and forging past the loss of Dumbledore, symbolic for protection and guidance. Harry Potter is a true man with amazing morale. . I LOVE THIS BOOK! Holy cow. It is such a good, heart-wrenching read! Wow!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n That was pretty enjoyable. Even though I had seen meme\\'s about Snape Killing Dumbledore, I was still surprised when it happened. \\n I don\\'t like how this book and the last just wind on and on after the pinnacle of the excitement. I don\\'t need to know who all attended Dumbledore\\'s funeral and that the merpeople sang for him and on and on. Maybe I would feel differently if I were really into it and I was reading it as it came out and not having all that formality in the way of me starting the next book., Such a bittersweet book. So many loose ends to tie. All leading up to the best conclusion in a series that I\\'ve ever read., lnskh@ lmtrjm@, Na, ezert erdemes ujraolvasni. Mig az elso alkalommal Dumlbledore halalakor esett le Siriuse es taglozott le, most csak sokszor sikerult elerzekenyulnom a sok szereteten. Es barmennyire is megoszto karakter Albus Dumblerdore, a \"Nem felek, Harry - felelte Dumbledore, a dermeszto viz ellenere talan egy arnyalatnyival erosebb hangon. - Itt vagy velem.\" resz megerintett. \\n Az egesz konyv soran lehetett latni a fejlodest, a szereplok ertek; nem feltetlen csak a trion volt fokusz, ez tetszett. A kovetkezo olvasasra talan sikerul a stilust is ertekelni; hihetetlen, hogy a tortenet meg mindig ennyire lebilincsel., I know the rest of the world has already read everything Harry Potter, so I don\\'t think there\\'s much I can add in the way of commentary that hasn\\'t already been said. Suffice to say I was hooked once again. My only regret is that there is only one more book to read and then it is all over. This is why I have taken so long to finish this book and why I\\'m reluctant to begin the last. The woman is a genius!, This is a re-read to prepare for the movie!, Most Recently Read: 07/09, 07/12, 07/13, 06/15, 07/16, 07/17, I loved this book probably my favorite book of the entire series to this point. I loved how they went back in time to see the story of the boy who becomes Lord Voldemort. I like stories within stories lol. Sad to see Dumbledore pass on I liked his character. now on to the finale the deathly Hallows., I know this isn\\'t literature, but I really can\\'t help loving these books. Once I start one, I can\\'t put it down. Must be the kid in me....., LOVE IT!! A bit more educational than the other books, though. Harry\\'s growing up, and we can really begin to see ti now. However, it\\'s JUST TOO GOOD!!!, What a fabulous book! Can you believe this series is on the banned books list? I was curious about why that\\'s the case, so I did a bit of googling and found this site, which goes into more detail about the ban. \\n My favorite reason? That people believe witchcraft is real (did we not learn from burning \"witches\" in the old timey days?), and further, that the Harry Potter series is going to convince children that witchcraft is fun instead of evil. \\n To read the rest of my review, please visit: \\n http://www.dorolerium.com/?p=3045, This is, by far, my favorite book of the series so far!! I was absolutely captivated through the entire book! Harry has really come into his own and I\\'m so proud of him, for not taking other people\\'s crap and for making decisions based on his own gut. Once again, my heart broke for him. Why can\\'t he ever get a break? He\\'s got a very limited amount of people that love him and that he loves and one by one, they\\'ve been picked off by Voldemort and Snape. Moving on to The Deathly Hollows today and cannot wait to read that Harry takes his revenge on these evil wizards!!, This book was definitley a favorite in the series it showed how friendship and love is one of the most important things to have and remember in a battle, Omgomgomg (the only appropriate response after finishing this book). All jokes aside, I freaking loved it! Can\\'t wait to get started on the deathly hallows x, Great Read - riveting and I could not put the book down, as with all Potter stories, Um..yeah every bit as good as I thought it always was, <3, The sixth book is the one I remembered the least before my reread on audio, but has also been the most enjoyable to rediscover., REREAD 2015 \\n This is always the saddest book in the series for me :( \\n REREAD 2013 \\n It\\'s been almost 6 years since I last read Half-Blood prince. I\\'m so glad I decided to re-read this HP book. It\\'s just one of the strongest books in the series and I think this is one of my favorites in the series. So many feels though ;_;, I have always thought that I didn\\'t like the last two Harry Potter books. Upon rereading the Half-Blood Price I realised how well constructed the story is and how I like the darker atmosphere in the book as well as I like the beginning of the story. The audiobooks narrated by Stephen Fry are gorgeous and a very good way to reread the series. I think I will purchase all of the books slowly on my way going through the whole series because they are the absolute comfort while walking around the city., Annual re-read 2013. I liked HBP much more this time. \\n Annual re-read 2017., An improvement over the disappointing fifth entry in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\" still doesn\\'t quite match the excellence of the first two novels., Everytime I finished one Harry Potter book I always said, I think this is my fave from all. \\n So it turns out I have 4 fave fave books from this series.. Does it even make sense? I could only sigh., I was too busy reading through these one after another to properly review each one individually, but I loved them! \\n I will write a more proper review whenever I end up rereading them. Till then..... :-), Great! I loved this one, lots of people didn\\'t or not as much as the others but it is right up there for me with the best because you really do some digging into key characters and the whole plot makes more sense once you see their POV and get their motivation. Of course I cried at the end but lets not lie the writing was on the wall for this one back in book 1. The mentor never lives. Lots of needed info in this one which was GREAT., Much better than the previous HP- tighter, more engaging, more exciting. Like the series, it\\'s magical in many ways, and full of heart and soul. Harry is much less angsty, and is shown to have grown up a lot. Draco also gets some good play in this one, along with Ginny. Couldn\\'t wait to read it every day, and may have actually sighed audibly when I finished it., ***Reread April 2014*** \\n ***Reread May 2017***, I hadn\\'t read this one in years, and, if I remember correctly, I\\'d only read it once before, but it\\'s just as good as I remember. And really so much better than the movie. \\n Still pisses me off that she killed Dumbledore, though. I think it always will., Six books down. \\n Bring It Deathly Hallows!!!, love., Magic, I\\'m a POTTERHEAD :), Last read Dec 8-10, 2010, Well, I\\'m not going to go into all the details of the plots and characters and such. Many have done that already. My purpose in my reviews is just to let you know if I liked the book or not. \\n I liked the book. I liked the series. \\n Okay, maybe I should be a little more honest than that. I loved the books. I love this series. I was one of the crazy people standing in line at midnight to get my book. (Thanks, mom, for watching the kids!) Or books since my husband and I had a problem sharing and often resorted to sabatoge and trickery to get the book. \\n Anyways, we\\'re big Harry Potter fans here. We have not read them to the kids. I don\\'t think they\\'re appropriate for kids. Sometime around the tweens/teens I\\'ll give it a whirl. \\n I was very sad when the series ended, but now I don\\'t have to spend years wondering and worryting about what will happen. And I can always re-read them. Which I do., Well other than Barry being a whiny brat I loved this book. they grow with you you\\'re not reading about a 16 year old in 11 year old language that\\'s nice, dY\\'-, This is the book in which the story blossoms. \\n Need I say more., I didn\\'t understand why Snape killed Dumbledore......, I somehow know how Harry feels in the last part of the book. The unable-to-sink-in feeling, that dry sadness. You can\\'t seem to digest the event because of anger and shock. You can\\'t cry nor scream. You just stare in to nothingness, through your numbness. And then as if suddenly woke up in the middle of the night, slowly sinking in you. The pain, the loss, and it hurts so much you just stood up and planned revenge. It is the aftermath that is the most difficult, the longing the realization. That is exactly how I felt when Snape killed Albus. ;( Sum it up with the fake Horcrux, with Bill being bitten, and the Ministry pursuing Harry. The only light thing happened on the last part is Tonks and Lupin., In Half-Blood Prince, Harry returns to Hogwarts for his sixth year. Times are a-changing. The Death Eaters are back. Harry\\'s dealing with the loss at end of book 5. Dumbledore has convinced one Professor Slughorn to return to Hogwarts to teach Potions which means Snape has taken over Defense Against the Dark Arts. This year, Harry discovers He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\'s goal of creating a mythical object known as a Horcrux. Dumbledore takes Harry with him to track down significant objects. Meanwhile Draco has Harry on edge. He\\'s acting suspicious and Harry wants to know why. \\n Of course, the ending of this book astonished everyone. I still can\\'t type it out. And I cry every time. This book just gets me right through the feels (actually this whole series does)., Second time reading this book it is one of my second favorite Harry Potter books and movie. <33, I had to reread the last few chapters to make sure it was really happening. All the wizards, witches, and creatures of Hogwarts and the magic world are being forced to choose sides of fall victim to Lord Voldemort., Dari semua Harry Potter yang gue baca, cuma buku ke 6 yang \\'kurang gue suka\\'... Kenapa?? Because headmaster is leaving us... :\\'(, ahw Dumbledore ))):, **The Harry Potter series was voted #1 on NPR\\'s 100 Best Ever Teen Novels, which allowed listeners to vote on their favorite YA novels. (2012), The writing in this book is less comparable to the others. There\\'s a lack of fluidity as if everything leading up to the ending was forced, especially with the plot device of the Felix Felicis., It\\'s Harry\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts and the Dark Lord\\'s force is more active than ever. In potions class, Harry finds a helpful yet dark book that belongs to the mysterious self-proclaimed \"Half-blood Prince.\" Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Harry work together to discover secrets about Voldemort\\'s past, and the secret that will get rid of him once and for all. This book is a lot of setup for the next and final book, but is still interesting. Young adults will also like the hormones that start to come out and the love interests that begin to develop among their favorite characters. There\\'s quite a shock at the end where Rowling yet again throws death in our face. Voldemort becomes a more round character as we see his past and pity his lack of love. High schoolers and adults alike will love entering the magical world of Harry Potter once more., Certainly more humorous than the previous installment, but its ending is even more emotionally devastating. I cannot believe I only have one more., I still can\\'t stop thinking about the ending of this book. And, I was even having dreams about Dumbledore last night after i finished it too. I mean, wth, seriously? While the Half-blood Prince is right up there with Prisoner of Azkaban for me, this one has been the most emotionally gripping and challenging so far. I\\'m still sad, confused, and worst of all, I feel betrayed - not only by the plot, but also by JRo. Why did you have to do this to Harry, to us readers? Why does evil always have to lurk its malevolent head around at the worst possible time? What happened to the happy endings of the first 3 years at Hogwarts? Well, I\\'m hoping the answers will come in Year 7, as I\\'m sure they will, and, more so than any of the others, I can\\'t wait to get started. Sigh...the only one he ever feared, yes indeed, the only one., Not my favorite book of the series. It took me quite a bit longer to get thru-it didn\\'t hold my attention like the others. This was one where I liked the movie version better :), The breathlessly plotted sixth installment of the Harry Potter saga plunges the reader head-long towards the boy wizard\\'s upcoming epic showdown with Lord Voldemort. The back story of Tom Riddle is fascinating and the novel\\'s multiple hair-raising adventures result in truly shocking payoffs. Minor quibbles include the fact that the novel is still structured around the now overly-familiar Hogwarts school year, as well as the silly love triangles that will likely induce eye-rolling in adult readers., I love the backstory in this one, and I like the more realistic idea that Harry might have some adult help in the final confrontation, but there are a couple things that keep bugging me about these books. 1) Mrs. Weasley depresses me. She cooks and cleans and complains about her daughter-in-law and doesn\\'t go to Quidditch world cups... the more we learn about her, the more one-dimensional and predictable she becomes, and I don\\'t think the one stay-at-home mom in the novel deserves that representation. 2) And, I mean, I love Hermione (obvi she\\'s the best character) and Ginny, but their tendency to go to the bathroom together, cry profusely at funerals (when the boys stoically hold back), marvel at the emotional stupidity of the boys around them, and fawn over love potions is distressing. 3) Love potions. Isn\\'t that just the date rape drug? Seems like there should be some regulations there. 4) Regulations! I want to know so much more about how this government system works! This isn\\'t necessarily a fault of the book, but just a demand for more books! I would rather any sequels completely abandon Harry as a character (because he\\'s kind of masculine and blah, right?) and focus more on the adult world. I especially am curious about how governmental powers and private enterprises work together? If there is \"ministry approved magic,\" WHY are they approving all these hexes??? 5) If there is something like a spell that refills drinks, then why does Slughorn have to spend all his money on buying mead? This is more a question about the limitations of magic in this world. There are so many little hints about those kind of everyday but fascinating details that distract me completely from all this Voldemort stuff that I\\'m sure will end up fine in the end. haha. 6) The teachers!!! Why don\\'t any of them have families??? Do they ever hook up together, then? Is there teacher training? Do they really get the best education when the headmaster has to limit his hiring pool to old bachelors and spinsters? \\n I mean...just so many questions! Also, I don\\'t think that Rowling does emotional depth very well. This ending shocked me but did not sadden me. Maybe that\\'s for the benefit of the intended audience, but I suspect it\\'s a flaw in the prose, because the same flatness occurs at multiple points earlier in the series., HARRY yang masih menyesal akibat terbunuhnya ayah baptisnya...kini harus bersedih kembali karena KEPSEK yang dia sayangi harus tewas di tangan guru yang tak pernah disukainya..., Excellent book!, So sad., Having finished the penultimate book of the series, I have one word for J.K. Rowling: ingenious. Each chapter of this series -- this book\\'s in particular -- served the story right, clearly written for a purpose. All the ideas thrown by Rowling from the very first book up to this, wrapped themselves together and have melted me into sublimity. One who had reached the sixth book cannot not read the seventh., Fav HP installment so far maybe?, Ce n\\'est pas parce qu\\'on a grandi avec Harry Potter qu\\'on doit necessairement l\\'adorer... Mais c\\'est le cas ! Et le tome 6, c\\'est pratiquement le meilleur ; des aventures d\\'ecoliers, des drames et des problemes causes par les forces du mal... tout y est ! La derniere aventure avant de quitter Poudlard a tout jamais ..., This one might be my favourite, Re-read., 7, If you were to manage to get to book 6 in this series without already appreciating how fleshed out the story was from book 1, you certainly couldn\\'t overlook the complex beauty of it now. Sure, at this point, there was (presumably) a legion of people working to avoid inconsistencies in the text. Nevertheless, the plot/characters/seemingly-off-hand-nuggets all come back to Rowling\\'s original and ongoing brilliance. This series is rich enough to read (or listen to) and enjoy multiple times, yet accessible enough to be children\\'s literature. \\n This book continues what began at the end of book 5, which is (finally) giving us a view into Dumbledore and his tireless work against Voldemort. Since Dumbledore is such a great character, this makes for fun reading. My favorite scene has to be when Dumbledore meets the Dursleys at the start of the book. \\n Of course, the light-hearted tone of the beginning is in stark contrast to the ending. Harry has had much to grieve for throughout his short life, and the loss continues. This book is all about setting him up to face his adulthood, maybe not alone, but at least independently. \\n It\\'s hard to remember what it must have been like to finish reading this and not have the last book in the series at your fingertips. First of all, you probably would have been disappointed that #6 was positively short compared to #5. But more importantly, you probably would have felt a little of what Harry might have felt: on the precipice and not knowing where his daunting task would lead him. \\n Things that I love about this book: the evolution of Malfoy and Snape as characters (Did you notice that they both have mothers, as does Voldemort?! Oh, the humanity...), the networking prowess and failings of Professor Slughorn, how Harry used the Felix Felicis potion, Tonks, the awful existence of horcruxes, and of course, the phoenix\\'s \"stricken lament of terrible beauty.\", I love when the characters are older and relationships are evolving. The Harry/Dumbledore moments and background to Voldemort was great, too. But again, more sadness., This book was about a Drastic change in Harry\\'s Life! \\n I Looooved the book! \\n This is my second fav book of HP series. The first fav is Prisoners of Azkaban, Wow! Holy crap!!! I just read this book in two days, I couldn\\'t put it down, and that\\'s quite a feat having two small children! This is now my favorite book of the series. Way better than the movie. The book explains so much more about Voldemort\\'s life that I understand him now as a character, his strengths and weaknesses. Character development and relationships are so much better explained in the book rather than the movie. I can\\'t wait to crack open the next book! I\\'ve only seen the last movies once so I feel as if I\\'m going into the last book a little blind. I am so thankful I went ahead and read the books anyway because I understand way more than I ever could have just relying on the movies!, JK Rowling must have done quite an elaborate series outline before writing the Harry Potter books! I was struck by how so many threads in previous books were coming together., I\\'ve both read and listened to this book., Book six done! One more to go!!, This title really could have benefitted from a different title. I was thinking that Half Blood Prince would refer to Voldemort, but the revelation was rather disappointing. It was interesting to learn more about the world of wizards and witches, and Snape\\'s backstory did a bit in helping to explain why he was the way he was. However, it was lacking, and though I did like this book, it simply was not as good as the preceding book because some things could have been done better., Okay, I admit there were quite a few things I didn\\'t like about this book, but overall I enjoyed it. I always have trouble with books balyhooed (is that a word) as the best thing ever., Long for what it contained., I seem to have always read HP6 in a hurry, to get through it the first time, to re-read before HP7, to re-read before the movie... so this time I took my time. And like with book 5, there are quite a few parts that make me twitchy, wishing I could either yell at Harry to give it up (the obsession with Malfoy, even if it turned out to be right, the whole sectumsempra part), or at Rowling herself (the way she describes the creature in Harry\\'s chest which growls and/or sleeps and/or is awakened re: Ginny)... and maybe not a lot happens, action-wise, until the last 130 pages, but I feel like the last 130 pages pack enough of a punch to make up for the things that drive me nuts. Obviously, I\\'m nitpicking, because I love these books, period, but it\\'s interesting to see how you feel upon your 5th re-read. I still remember the shock upon certain revelations, and that\\'s part of why these books will always be favorites., I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I cannot stress how much i want people to read the books before they see the movies. This books is amazing, so detailed, so exquisite. Its a must read, the entire series is a must read., I think this was the toughest one to read yet. I found it a little slower than the other books. I also had put it down in order to focus on book reviews and other life stuff. It\\'s been interesting to read Harry Potter and watch him grow up with adult eyes., emotionally bothering and painful i thought i can\\'t continue to read anymore. but i have to. Snape gave me strength. HAHAHA. Oh Severus Snape, my number one hated/loved character of all time. Mysterious/Ambiguous/Puzzling. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, HALF BLOOD PRINCE :))))) 3, The war against Valdemort is not going well. Many people have died. Harry joins Dumbledore in a quest to locate all seven parts of Valdemort\\'s soul--so he can be killed once and for all. Along the way, Harry realizes he\\'s in love with Ginny Weasley and Ron and Hermione hook up, sort of. I am now re-reading all the Harry Potter books, picking up forgotten details not in the movies. It\\'s interesting doing a re-read of a story with so many twists and turns over 7 volumes. Details barely noticed in the first reading, as the books were published, now make more sense. What an incredible story!, planning to re-read in preparation for the movie!, HPHBP was always one of the middle-of-the-road books for me in the series. \\n You learn so much in this book and the series starts to come to a close. It\\'s definitely getting darker, Harry & everyone else is getting older and relationships are starting to develop. You start to see the beginnings of a relationship form between Hermoine and Ron, and you finally get to see Harry be happy in his relationship with Ginny. \\n Of course we find out about Horcruxes, about Voldemort\\'s past, and how to kill Voldemort. \\n Re-reading the book, it bugs me all the more about the \"Half Blood Prince\" bit however. The book is called the Half Blood Prince, yet we spend all of two seconds on \"I am the half blood prince\". Yes, naturally, the Potions book and the notes from the half-blood prince helps Harry to no end, but shouldn\\'t the book have been \"Harry Potter and the never ending struggle to find out the truth\" ? Nah, it doesn\\'t have quite the same ring, but that\\'s my point: I feel like the title was just to sell more books, and Rowling certainly didn\\'t need to do that in this point of the series. \\n I didn\\'t enjoy the pacing as much in this one, and I find myself not liking Dumbledore a great deal, either. I always at least respected him in previous reads of the series, though I hated the way he treated and used Harry. This time though, I just see the poor treatment of Harry, which in real world terms almost amounts to mental abuse. The poor kid - and I think sometimes we forgot Harry IS just a KID just wants some attention, after all. Yes, there\\'s the whole revenge of his parents thing and he\\'s all noble and everything, but he\\'s still a kid who just wants parental attention. Look how quickly he got attached to Sirius after all., Did not see that end coming.... \\n Straight on to the final book. Can\\'t wait to find out what happens., So just updating all my past read.. It has been years since I read these books but I recall the stories fondly and the wait to get the newest one at that time so long. There may never be a series I give myself to as I did these. This review will be on all the books., I have just regathered my thoughts after having a sob over the end of this book - and not even the bits about Dumbledore! The bit that gets me the most is: \"The crowd continued the swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna. They alone of all the DA had responded to Hermione\\'s summons the night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew why: they were the ones who missed the DA the most...probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in hope that there would be another meeting...\" (598). \\n JK Rowling, words cannot describe how awesome you are!, Reread 2017 - this book was ruined for me by spoilers a day after it came out. This read was more enjoyable by far., I seem to have a theme for each Harry novel and this one was no exception, I like to refer to it as the Teenager Era. Yes, hormones are running rampid and Harry, is in love, is jealous, is fighting, and generally is just growing up. \\n The entire novel reads almost like a prologue to the upcoming finale (except for the fact that its over 600 pages long). Things have stepped up a notch as the Wizarding world finally begins to acknowledge that the Dark Lord has returned, the Minister of Magic has been sacked as Knightbolt installed in his place. \\n Under pressure to become the PR face of the Ministry, Harry returns to Hogwarts to discover Snape in the DADA position with Slugworth, an arrogant name dropping past professor of his parents now teaching Potions. The school terms become a series of papers and homework as Harry struggles to keep up, with the help of a Potions textbook, previously owned by one Half-Blood Prince. \\n The events of the last few chapters seem almost isolated from the rest of the novel as it all rushes towards the tragic (and almost universally predicted) conclusion, truly setting the stage for the end. A much better read than the Angry Harry novel, but too many loose ends to be all that memorable., Good book, sadly not nearly as good as her other books. I have high hopes for the seventh book. I just hope she can pull off the darker feeling and still keep the plot in one piece., Seneng bgt pas tau Harry-nya akhirnya sama Ginny. Tp Dumbledore-nya mati hu..hu..., It it\\'s often said \"the journey is more important than the destination\". That adage seems to have been forgotten with this entry in the Harry Potter series. While the dramatic finale of the book is in no doubt one of the, if not the most significant moment of the series so far, everything leading up to it feels like just that: a rather long lead up. Half-Blood Prince lacks any real plot of its own. A few things happen, but these events feel disjointed and fleeting rather than crucial elements driving the story forward or contributing to something larger. \\n Half-Blood Prince felt like a filler book, written primarily to set up for Deathly Hallows. Even the book itself is packed with filler and emphasis placed on the wrong things. Interesting elements of things that are going on are glosssed over, yet pages and pages are dedicated to awkward romance and \"snogging\". I am sad to say that this is my least favourite of the series., Bought the hard cover in Heathrow airport during a boycott of British Airline from their food vendor, Gateway. Got stuck in Heathrow for 27+ hr, had the Ukrainian porcelain teapot smashed except one by the carrier, and read this book., I couldn\\'t get into it, so I stopped tormenting myself and walked away., My favorite Harry Potter book!, I didn\\'t saw it coming. I haven\\'t think of Snape in the first place to do that thing. Dumbledore. Oh! Dumbledore! T_T, 24 December 2014 \\n 2 September 2016, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I cried when Albus dead :(, I liked this book so much more this time around. I think I overlooked it, both in book and in movie format. I really didn\\'t remember a whole lot about it. It\\'s freaking awesome. \\n Also, Ginny is a badass and I love her., Still good, My second favorite book of the Harry Potter series, I\\'m re-reading all the Harry Potter books! yeah!, I Love this!, This brought out the darker side of the Magical world and how some students seemed to be able to fool Dumbledore..., OMG I cant believe this just happened, In the 6th Harry Potter book, Harry is using an old textbook for his potions class. Only he seems to be able to read the \"invisible\" ink that \"corrects\" some of the potions in the book. The book is signed \"Half-Blood Prince\". Harry is also taking personal lessons from Dumbledore. And more - actually a lot happens in this book! \\n In fact more happened in this book than I remembered, and once again, I really enjoyed it, maybe more than the first time around. I listened to the audio narrated by Jim Dale. This is the third HP book I\\'ve listened to, narrated by him, and the fourth book I\\'ve listened to, overall, narrated by him. He\\'s finally growing on me and I finally see the appeal. He actually does do some very good effects while narrating, and it\\'s often easy to pick out who is speaking, just by the voices he does., can I say, currently rereading in preparation for the new one which sits, waiting for me?, Good read. Really intense. Keeps you going and going and going and going., ** spoiler alert ** \\n One of the most shocking and surprising books in the Harry Potter series. \\n Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for anybody, Voldemort and the Death Eaters are attacking both the Muggle World and the Wizarding World. Harry returns to Hogwarts for his 6th year, during this year he comes across a book that belongs to the Half-Blood Prince, which contains many secrets about Voldemort\\'s past. \\n Harry\\'s arch-nemesis, Draco Malfoy has a much larger role in this book than in the previous 5, and before reading this book everybody probably thought Malfoy was just a little monster, and a spoiled brat, and of course he\\'s in Slytherin. But after this one you feel kind of bad for him because we see a different side to him. Harry becomes highly suspicious that Draco is now a Death Eater, following his father\\'s footsteps, and is believed to be carrying out a most-deadly task for the Dark Lord. \\n Professor Snape is now the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher (a job he\\'s been after for years), and newcomer Horace Slughorn has taken Snape\\'s position as Potions master. \\n In this book the love-lives of the main characters start to become more active. Harry begins to develop strong feelings for Ron\\'s younger sister Ginny, but is reluctant to begin a relationship because of his friendship with Ron. Ron and Hermione also grow closer together. Fleur Delacour (from The Goblet of Fire) is engaged to Ron\\'s older brother Bill. \\n Dumbledore begins scheduling regular meetings with Harry, and they use Dumbledore\\'s Pensieve (a Stone Basin used to see past memories in a 3rd-person point of view) to look at the memories of those who have had contact with Voldemort. Harry and Dumbledore learn more about Voldemort\\'s past and learns he became obsessed not only with power but with gaining eternal life. \\n Harry discovers one of Voldemort\\'s only weaknesses, a Horcrux, a powerful object which a Dark wizard can hide a fragment of his soul for the purpose of obtaining immortality, for example Tom Riddle\\'s (Voldemort\\'s former name) Diary from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which Harry destroyed to defeat Voldemort\\'s ghost form of his younger self. Realizing that destroying the other Horcruxes is the only way to destroy Voldemort once and for all, Harry accompanies Dumbledore to a cave far away from Hogwarts, to retrieve a suspected Horcrux, Slyherin\\'s Locket. \\n Another great addition to the Harry Potter series, the ending really surprised me, but I won\\'t give anything away to those of you who have yet to read it, I don\\'t want to spoil it., 2nd time 8/07, Still good, but a bit to dark., Wow, my first Harry Potter read. I must say JK knows how to write a book. She makes it seem that she wrote it all in one sitting. Very smooth, and compelling. A must read for everyone., It\\'s fascinating how hard it is to find people who disliked reading this book as much as I did. I thought all the foreboding in this was waaaay overdone and the plot incredibly predictable (I pretty much called this book\\'s death from the first few chapters) and some of the characters\\' lines just seemed...fake. And forced. In fact, it all seemed forced. When i talk to people about which one they disliked the most, i usually hear the 5th \"because Harry was so moody!\" Or maybe, perhaps he was a teenager going through a lot of issues (ya know, like the person who killed your parents is alive again, your godfather is still believed to be a psycho, oh and that psychic who killed your parents is in your head, nbd) and constantly exposed to the public.I got that this was a filler novel, and that\\'s fine, but it would have been a ton better if Rowling had just kept the characters growing in her series rather than fall for the cliche. I hate saying this, but the only thing that redeemed the series for me was the movie of this book followed by the 7th movies. I read book seven only out of necessity and like any other book. Not one from a series that I used to reread on a monthly basis., I liked this one. I can definitely tell it is a \"transition\" book, setting the last book up for the finale., Perhaps there is something wrong with me. \\n Yes, I know that this author is loved round the world, despite her self-professed dislike of children. Anyoen who reads her books should be able to clearly see how much she dislikes them; deaht, suffering, torture, and sadness strike every character, in every book, and it actually gets WORSE as the story wears on. \\n As far as I\\'m concerned, you\\'d have to be a full-blown sociopath, incapable of any human empathy for the characters of this series, not to be profoundly disturbed by the awful, hideous fate the author delivers onto her main character. If you think Dumbledore being tortured to retrieve an ultimately useless relic is fun, please avoid me. If you think you\\'d like to live in this world, you require psychological help. This tale is a grim medley, punctuated with hatred, bigotry, racism, abuse of pretty much every kind, neglect and murder. \\n Oh, but it\\'s all set in the wonderful world of Chaotic Neutral magic, so it\\'s fun all \\'round! \\n This book is by far the most depressing, ugly, horrific and not enjoyable book in the series. It was so horrid I don\\'t even want to read the last one., Most people will claim that this was the most disturbing book out of the series, due to the deaths and the betrayals in the storyline. I found it to be a slightly lighter book than the Order of the Phoenix, in that Harry has an easier time, for the most part (if not for Professor Snape) up until the very end. Despite the fact that he is dealing with the loss of his godfather, Sirius, it is the first of the books where Harry actually has moments where he is is experiencing the life of an ordinary boy, fixating on the potential of an actually healthy relationship, achieving some sense of status as a heroic figure to be admired and not shunned and whispered about in derogatory ways... He appears to be coming into his own, despite the experiences of the previous book. In fact, the only thing that is at all frustrating for him, is the fact that his hard-core group of friends refused to nurture his suspicions of Malfoy. I like the book, for all its twists and turns, and the exploration into the past of Voldemort, was fascinating. It was nice to see the humanity of the villain in the story arch--not in the sense of being an ordinary boy, or even good, but--before he could be quantified as purely evil. As usual, Rowling takes a long time to get to the real action, but I can honestly say it\\'s well worth the wait. As Harry verges on the cusp of the final showdown between him and his nemesis, this book poises the reader for what is to come., This is the sixth year that Harry Potter and his friends go to Hogwarts and they learn some new magic tricks. Dumbledore is surprisingly absent from the school most of the time. Harry finds some strange but extremely useful help from the half-blood prince. Harry searches for the story about how a young boy became Lord Voldemort., Bawled my head off....every time I read it., Even though Dumbledore died I didnt cry, n the fact that Snape had a larger part was AWESOME!! xD, This series made me feel like a kid again., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Dumbledore dies? After all that? Snape is bad, after all the \"I trust him\" crap from D and the Order?! Arrgghh! I was not happy with this one. Very disappointed and sad . . . I wanted things to be happier, even though it\\'s a serious thing happening now, but still . . . Things tended to work out in the other books, but this one ends on a down beat. I hope the last one has some redeeming stuff. \\n (A great series, all that aside)., Obviously a reread. Loved it as always. Stephen Fry is great as a narrator!, There\\'s a lot about this book I enjoy but I feel like there\\'s not much that happens. It\\'s just setting us up for the last book, which is appropriate. It\\'s a good thing I like the relationship aspect of this story or I think I would have been bored by this book. I sort of feel like she was getting tired of writing about school stuff., tears., Just finished the 6th Harry Potter book. In each book I am learning more and more about Harry Potter, his friends and even his enemies- more than the movies shared. This book had a little more air of mystery and very riveting. Ready to start the 7th book!, Probably the best one so far., I thought this book was marvelous I just loved finding out what wasn\\'t able to make it into the movie. The scene\\'s involving Ginny and Harry I found to be the most interesting because on film Ginny\\'s character doesn\\'t develop much if at all. But in the book it\\'s easier to see Ginny as her own person. Dumbledor\\'s death and funeral was a tear jerker written in the most heart felt of ways. In this book I was able to see the point in Harry\\'s life where the war begins and childhood fancies end., is it wrong that i like the movie better than the book? the fact that they couldn\\'t make a 10 hour movie means 100\\'s of pages that i just didn\\'t enjoy from the book got cut. the horcruxes don\\'t make sense to me in the book. why devote hundreds of pages to the things if dumbledore already knows what it\\'s all about. hundreds and hundreds of pages devoted to discovering voldemort\\'s origins and his interest in the horcruxes, but dumbledore already knows. he could have taken 10 minutes, maybe 40 pages, to just tell harry this stuff. why make him go through the months of trying to figure it out himself. just make a 300 page \"tom riddle and the soul splitting horcruxes\" book if the backstory is that important. lots of filler here. at least in the movie, dumbledore is genuinely surprised by the memory, you know? he is like, \"oh goddamn, i need to sit down right now. this book that got stabbed that one time and this ring that i have are mf\\'ing horcruxes. no wonder my hand is all burned up and shit.\" makes more sense to me. \\n other thoughts, i enjoyed draco. rickman is snape. ginny is awkward. harry should be with luna obviously. dumbledore going full super saiyan gandalf was amazing, and i support ron and hermoine even though jk might have given up on them. \\n i mean, they spend all kinds of time together when harry is out doing his thing, and while ron might not be harry, he is still a pretty decent guy, comes from a good family and whatnot, gets good marks in school, built pretty decent, good at sports, good at wizard\\'s chess, fairly brave for the most part. a tad whiny at times, but nobody is perfect, right?, A let-down after the excellent book 5, this volume is an unnecessary filler focusing on Harry\\'s social and love life at Hogwarts, while war between the Order and Voldemort\\'s followers is raging outside. Contains many looks at Voldemort\\'s life through collected memories, most of which aren\\'t that interesting., Harry is extra annoying here. \\n \"Rawr, Draco. I hate Draco. I\\'m ANGRY. Voldemort isn\\'t controlling me anymore but let me argue with my best friends because EVERYTHING IS MALFOY\\'S FAULT.\" \\n Females, especially teenage girls, do very strange things for revenge. \\n Even knowing the ending, it hurts a bit to read., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I had predicted that Dumbledore would die by the end of this book, but when it all happened I was still surprised by how, even though I should have seen it coming. I figured that\\'s what Dumbledore and Snape had been whispering about all year long. And somehow I never saw it coming that Snape was the half-blood prince. All in all, a great book and a great way to lead up to the Deathly Hallows., Snape You Are Horrible TT, Legendary books., Listened to it again on cd in my car!!! I love this book, This was by far the most addictive of the 6 so far, in rereading, perhaps because it was a bit blurry in remembering it. I mean, harry potter means inferi/zombies? That\\'s pretty freaking cool. And I really love that HP and dumbledore finally develop their father/son-like relation, because I always feel like dumbledore is holding out those first few years. This one also sets up the whole SNAPE issue for the last book., just re-read it on our trip home from florida., I watched the interview with Jim Dale in which he describes how he created the many, many voices of Rowling\\'s wonderful books. In it he mentions that he doesn\\'t like the word actor. He believes that the performer shouldn\\'t act the character, he should be the character. And, wow does he succeed! Jim Dale is bloody brilliant! I would listen to him read anything., It\\'s been sitting on my shelf for 2 years! \\n Ok, I finally read it, and WOW. I really want to both purchase all the rest of the books (i have 5 and 6) and go back and read all of them. But I still have to read 7 first! I thought it was a tight, well-done story, although it referenced 5 so much I really have to go back and read it or watch the movie. \\n Even though i knew who died at the end, I was still saddened by the result and cried through the last few chapters. And I feel pretty dumb because i thought the title SURELY referenced Voldemort, and...I was wrong! Goober. I do think Rowling gave a little bit away in the prologue bit when she revealed some of Voldemort\\'s followers and indeed they turned out to be bad guys at the end. \\n Regardless, it\\'s a series that would benefit reading through it again in one fell swoop. And I intend to do that ASAP!, Last time I read it: 4/2014, This is my favorite of the Harry Potter books, Best one so far. I couldn\\'t put it down., It\\'s Harry Potter, need I say more?!, I cried., i loved this harry potter. not only was it dark and funny, but you also got a lot of back story which is really interesting (the first time you read it)., borrowed from valerie. another good one... actually i was starting to think that it would only be ok but it took a turn for the much better around page 500. (i actually picked up a 650 page book and thought \"oh yay this one\\'s short!\") \\n reread oct 2015, Loved them all!, This fabulous series is coming in for the close with this book. It\\'s great to solve some of the mysteries and learn more about what it to come for Harry! Each book in this series improves from the previous (already amazing) book!, Oh man. Cried my eyes out., How can you not love Harry Potter??? I listen to the books on CD all the time., My favorite in the series. I\\'m a Snape fangirl., My favorite HP book. She could have stopped here and I would have been happy., When I finished this book, I was crying tears of joy and sadness! And I couldn\\'t stop untill I completely got out of the \"Book-Fase\"! \\n LOL \\n This book is adventurous, mysterious, and sad all in the end!, With Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters wreaking havoc on both the Wizarding and Muggle communities, Harry Potter is ready to start a new year at Hogwarts. But this year is different. Professor Dumbledore has promised to give Harry private lessons. Using the pensieve, Dumbledore and Harry learn of Voldemort\\'s past, hoping to discover a way that they can defeat him. Harry is also concerned about Draco Malfoy, who he believes has become a Death Eater. Another worry is Professor Snape who seems to share a secret with Draco...a secret that could change everything. \\n The sixth book in the Harry Potter series is the darkest to date. Harry seems to be growing up fast, dealing with both school work and the ongoing battle with Voldemort. He has also discovered a book of potions with notes in it from someone who called themselves the Half-Blood Prince. The last few chapters of this book are shocking and leave me wanting to jump right into the final book in the series. My rating: 5 Stars., This is what you have been waiting for., I cried when I read this book. My top favorites in Harry Potter series., loved it!, Reading this to Emma... \\n October 24-26, 2012 - Rereading... \\n October 25-27 2011, I really enjoyed this installment even though the ending made me cry like a baby., i think Half Blood Prince is now my favorite book of the series (hampir setara sm Goblet of Fire!) GA SIAP BUAT DEATHLY HALLOWS oh god, I\\'ll write a joint review when I\\'m through the last book., Ohhhh! What a book! I\\'m so glad I am reading this series. This book was awesome. Sad and tragic, but oh so awesome! I decided not to list this as a good YA book because it\\'s a bit dark. It\\'s getting so good, I stayed up last night and started the last book in the series. I sooooo wanna know what\\'s going to happen... it\\'s killin me!, # \\n CompNtBk \\n Borrowed from library. \\n FS: \"It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind.\" \\n LS:, I liked this one more than the others. I appreciated getting to know more of Voldemort\\'s backstory, and I was shocked with the ending. I\\'m excited to start #7. Almost done reading... Then I can watch the movies!, When I began rereading this series back in February 2011, my aim was to take them slow and perhaps do one a year. There was no rush, I thought, having already read them and with newer and different things to read. \\n And yet I managed to fit in books 4 and 5 last year, and now, having only recently caught the terrestrial television premier of Deathly Hallows part 2 (despite the DVD languishing unopened for years) I have a burning desire to finish the series yet again. \\n Half-Blood Prince, at the time, I liked quite a lot. I did rush through it of course, how could I not? It was a Potter release. Yet the full impact of things didn\\'t really hit me, I fear, because I came away a little disheartened. \\n You can argue that I was supposed to: the end of the novel certainly doesn\\'t cause you to think that the final book in the series will be as light and fun as a walk in the park. Still, something didn\\'t sit right with me, and I wondered, in a brooding, teen-age way, just where Rowling was taking my precious series. Of course, that\\'s silly. But I\\'d lived with Harry for some time now and, by this time, had amassed a considerable collection of fanfiction to go along with the official stories. I was at that stage of Potterhood where every morsel of trivia, every new spell or creature introduced, each new fact about the world slipped in was a diamond and a treasure and, yes, I\\'ll admit this, the stage where speculation and guesswork were more fun and rewarding than just waiting to have things revealed from the oracular Rowling. \\n Of my initial reading, the two scenes that stand out best are Harry\\'s trip to retrieve Slughorn\\'s memory, more than the extraction itself, which is odd. And, unsurprisingly, the flight of the prince, which I have heard Fry read time and time again. At just under ten minutes into the chapter, when \"He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape\\'s head; Snape shouted, \"Run, Draco!\" and turned\". Those six minutes or so with that very personal and powerful duel, despite not being big on action, make for intense and powerful reading. \\n This time around, I enjoyed the romance more. Reading it at first, I found the teen emotions and all the snogging distracting from the story line, and yet the light humour and those sprinklings of Humanity are really what it\\'s all about, aren\\'t they? \\n I\\'m going to have to read Deathly Hallows next, there\\'s just no way around that now. I\\'m caught up once again in this most powerful and compelling of series, and even knowing how things go, I have to go through them. I suppose I was a little foolish to think that I could just dip in, one book a year, and let the world carry on at the same time. I should have known me well enough to understand that when things start to sweep along, I\\'d inevitably get caught in their wake. The first three, even four books are essentially Harry to me. They saw me out of my childhood, yes, but embody a lightness and a fun the latter books can\\'t match. But it\\'s that fun, that freedom, that sense lost in the later works that Harry is really fighting for. The only way out is through. Things are darkest before the dawn. That sort of thing. I\\'m going to start Deathly Hallows on my way home from work, as I\\'m penning this review on my way thereto. Not that it\\'s been a review in the traditional sense - I haven\\'t even mentioned dumbledoreisnotdead.com (so utterly compelling and yet bonkers), Rowling\\'s amazing foreshadowing (that scene where he hides the book: superb!), The extra dialogue between Malfoy and Albus on the tower (mysterious and hugely controversial), or the brilliance of Dumbledore and of Snape, both in their own ways. But I don\\'t need to, do I? Because if you\\'re reading this, either you\\'re such a fan that you already know these things, or you\\'re not so involved that my mentioning them would matter to you. Perhaps, when I reread the books in another decade, or two, or even a quarter of a century hence (assuming I haven\\'t been worked or childrened to death by that point), then who knows what things will leap out at me from these pages. These pages which are unchanging, and yet that offer new things each time you look at them. How clever is that? \\n I am going to save this review now and go and dig out the final book from my library of ebooks, transfer it to my ereader, and work with the warm, contented glow that having a very enjoyable read ahead of me always provides., My all time favorite book series... of all time. Definitely recommend to ANYONE. No matter what age you are, you will absolutely enjoy this book. J.K. Rowling is genius with character creation and an enthralling plot that will have you reading all of the books within a one month span. Love Love Love LOVE! Can\\'t say enough except that I am a Harry Potter fanatic for life. The books come to life in this series. Wonderful and ten million times better than the films (although those are great too). Thanks for reading the review! Mischief Managed ;), Two impressions, as there are several hundred reviews of this book and I don\\'t wish to reiterate: \\n **Reading this for the third time, I am struck by how much I did not remember was in here, as well as what I thought happened in this volume, but it must be in the next. The history of the Half-Blood Prince not being revealed, for one. \\n **The supreme length of this book makes me wonder what more marvelous things could have been revealed to us had the first two books of the series been as extensive., Loved, loved, loved it! OotP starts getting into alot more action, and there\\'s even more in this book. I\\'ve read this book a few times and still tear up at the end., Read August 2, 2011, Re-read: 27/12/2016 \\n This is probably my favorite Harry Potter book, mostly because even though it has a lot of sad and desperate moments, it also has a lot of bright ones (which is a nice change after Order of the Phoenix). \\n Probably the most interesting part of Half-Blood Prince is all the time Harry spent with Dumbledore learning about Voldemort\\'s past. Another definite plus is, how to put it, romantic awaking of out main protagonists, although Ron and Hermione\\'s scenes were sometimes more than cringy. I was right there, standing next to Harry and feeling awkward during some of their conversations. \\n What I really liked though was space Rowling gave Ginny. Although I\\'d still like to see even more of her, I can\\'t help but love what an amazing, funny and strong woman she is becoming. \\n The ending, of course, left me heartbroken. Not only because of Dumbledore\\'s death, but also because of the pure fact that Harry won\\'t return to Hogwarts in the next book. I know that these books need to evolve, but I will REALLY miss Hogwarts with Ginny, Neville, Luna, McGonagall, etc. After all, Hogwarts is Harry\\'s home. And he\\'s already lost enough. \\n All in all, re-reading these books is making me so devastated I\\'m really afraid to start reading the last one. But here we go anyway..., My thoughts on this book are as follows: \\n OMG DUMBLEDORE. \\n :( \\n That is all. \\n ***** \\n Read: \\n January 2009 \\n December 2011 (Audiobook) \\n November/December 2016 (Audiobook), Is this the best one so far? Yes., This is the first book to make me ACTUALLY cry since TFIOS...not teary eyes, but SOBS. Bravo, JKR. Bravo., I enjoy Harry Potter, but they are so long!, This one is still on the dark side. The Inferi might be a bit much. It doesn\\'t drag as much as The Order of the Phoenix., Well written book, but instead of liking Harry Potter more and more. I find myself thinking that he is more and more of a prat., very nice, Reread December 2013 \\n I read all the books aloud to my younger brother, and it\\'s lovely to reread them, definitely comfort books...this is only the second time I\\'ve read this one, and it\\'s amazing some of the details I missed the first time around., Okay, #6 redeemed the series after my hate for #5. I definitely didn\\'t remember this one (or the 5th) as much as I remembered the first four, so that\\'s made them a little more exciting to read. I\\'ll never be a huge Harry Potter fangirl, but they are fun reads and I\\'m looking forward to reading the last one soon!, 3) un libro che e diventato un film, This is my favorite HP book because we learn quite a bit of information about the Dark Lord, including his past, his family, and how he thinks. We also get a lot of history and interesting back story about the wizarding world, coupled with fascinating plot twists and a developing mentorship between Harry & Dumbledore. This was the book that caused the most speculation among fans, and has continued to keep us guessing, even after we\\'ve finished the series. There are plenty of aha moments and pieces finally fitting together in this book as well, which makes for an exciting read., I have watched the Movie haven\\'t read the book, Currently re-reading this in preparation for the release of book 7. I don\\'t care if it\\'s totally geeky, I love these books unabashedly, and can\\'t wait for the final chapter. It\\'s been building for so long, and for once I\\'ll be able to see something as it unfolds - I can only imagine having watched Psycho without knowing the ending, or reading The Mysterious Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde without knowing that Jekyll was Hyde. Plus, that delightful anticipation..., Well, what can I say about the latest Harry Potter book? Wow..... I am 22 years old and have been a big fan of the Harry Potter stories after I borrowed the first 3 books from a friend. You will not be disappointed with the latest developments. \\n Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince started off a bit political and I found myself wondering about the relevance of the first couple of chapters but the story quickly moved on. There are moments when I laughed out loud - the spells that go horribly wrong, the \\'who fancies who\\' stories and the general childish pranks. JK has managed to balance the underlying threat of \\'He Who Must Not Be Named\\' and the eventual death of a character with the everyday school stuff. You realise that the characters are a lot more mature now and there are interested in the opposite sex and the jealousy really begins to show. I feel that the teenage \\'romance\\' was justified and disagree with people who say that it was unnecessary. That sums up 16 year olds today I\\'m afraid. I would like to have seen more of Dobby as I think he\\'s great. I didn\\'t guess the identity of the Half Blood Price at all but I did feel that that became irrelevant as the story went on. The \\'death\\' scene is fantastically handled, the realisation of what has happened hits you but the story does not end there, I\\'m afraid that book defiantly leaves you wanting more, there is so much more to discover!, My favorite of the series so far. Seriously, I cried over a book about MAGIC!, I love this series., I read this within two weeks of the publication date and it didn\\'t disappoint! When the film came out I found myself very disappointed that scenes that I felt important weren\\'t there, and that they created scenes that weren\\'t in the book that didn\\'t seem to have any purpose except to give someone or other more screen time. This is definitely one of those instances where the book was much better than the movie!, May 15th, 2013, ** spoiler alert ** \\n After all these years, it still brings tears and goosebumps, the grief that Dumbledore is no more still touches the heart... \\n \\'Severus ...\\' \\n The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading. \\n Snape said nothing, but walked forwards and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed. \\n Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face. \\n \\'Severus ... please ...\\' \\n Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore. \\n \\'Avada Kedavra!\\' \\n A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape\\'s wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry\\'s scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight., First read when is came out, reread several times, most recently in 8/13 with my children., This is probably my most favorite Harry Potter book. It set the scene of what was going to happen in the Deathly Hallows. Also, this book gave more insight on Severus Snape. It also shows the burden that was placed on Draco and really how much he disliked it, This one was sad, they all made me cry though. Pathetic..., Wow... this one was really difficult to read aloud. There were many tears at the end, both mine and Oscars., Recently re-read., I absolutly cant wait until the next one comes out., It was my \"least favourite\" of the whole saga., This is where it got reeeeeally dark. I simply adore this one, it really got to me. I remember how I felt after I\\'d finished it, after Dumbledore\\'s funeral and Harry leaving Ginny because everyone around him dies... I was in the shower for at least half an hour crying. Masterpiece., My lower rating of this book has to deal with the ending. I just couldn\\'t believe it! But again it was a great book and I zoomed through it in one day!, I loved entire Harry Potter series, I think her books are very creative and well thought out. The visual immagrey is amazing, i felt as lf i could really \"see\" what was going on., I\\'m really enjoying my re-read through the series. Jim Dale does an amazing job with the narration, and I don\\'t think these stories will ever get old for me. In this book we start to see the future romantical relationships between characters really crystallize, but my favorite part of Half-Blood Prince is the glimpses into Voldemort\\'s past. The flashbacks make the world seem fully-realized, a place that has always existed with its own rich history. I haven\\'t yet read any of the newly released Potterverse stories (I KNOW) but really, there is a reason that JKR is basically the richest person in the world. She has a fantastic imagination and I don\\'t even know how she managed to come up with all the details of the wizarding world. \\n Like I said, I\\'m pretty sure these books will always amaze me. Always., I ugly cried through the last like, 75 pages of this book, This volume was the most difficult one for me: I\\'ve only read this one once., I found it really hard to put this one down. I\\'ve listened to it every available moment during the day and late into the night. What a fantastic book! \\n I\\'d have to say that people who get their panties in a was over these books have most likely just not read them. \\n Great material for a book discussion group., The book that broke my heart! \\n Dumbledore :( :( :( :(, If I could give 1/2 stars, this would be 4.5. It\\'s not quite a 5 but it\\'s really good -- at least to someone like me who wants to know the backstory of the characters. We finally find out more about Voldemort\\'s early life (though not exactly why he\\'s as evil as he is). I won\\'t give away the ending but I already knew what was coming having talked to someone who had previously read it so I wasn\\'t quite as shocked as some other readers have been. There were a few questions left unanswered and of course, suspense set up for the final installment. \\n ** SPOILER ALERT!! ** It was very satisfying to see Harry\\'s feelings towards Ginny suddenly blossom, to see his inner thoughts and conflicts about her and Ron and finally to have them start dating. And though Ron and Hermione aren\\'t officially a couple, watching the emotions between them has been fun too. SPOILER ENDED \\n I plan on starting the seventh book in a couple of days and I\\'m being honest when I say I\\'ll miss the characters I have grown to care about over the last 8 months when it is finally all said and done., Lots of action in this one, although there were parts that seemed to drag a bit (mostly involving Slughorn, not one of my favorite characters). Harry does seem to be becoming more and more full of himself in this book, and at times I found myself sympathizing with Snape during their conversations. Others have criticized Hermione for her mooning over Ron, but I think she was presented as so serious, studious and older than her years in the first few books that the reader tends to forget she\\'s still a teenage girl and none of her actions are uncharacteristic for that age group. Cho Chang was MUCH more annoying, in my opinion, and I was happy that nothing developed there. I can\\'t believe there\\'s only one book to go (sadface)., I thought this book was really good even though it\\'s sad!, My fave of the set!, RIP Dumbledore, Releido Septiembre 2016 #LeeLaMagia \\n Esta es solo mi segunda vez con esta historia, y la primera vez fue tan pirata que ni siquiera era la traduccion oficial sino una hecha por fanaticos. \\n Ha pasado tanto tiempo y he visto tantas veces la pelicula, que no recordaba casi nada. \\n Me gusto el libro, mas que todo porque leyendolo pude ver como funcionan los ships en esta historia. A ver, soy completamente delusional, y no shippeo ninguna de las parejas canon, pero aqui entiendo por que lo hacen. \\n Odio a Ginny Weasley, pero puedo ver como Harry se enamoro de ella, y el HermionexRon era demasiado obvio. \\n Asi no me guste xD \\n No pense que fuera a llorar tanto con la muerte de Dumbledore y sin embargo lo hice, la descripcion del ambiente y las reacciones de los personajes me llegaron al corazon. \\n Ahora me pregunta, ?como seria la vida del Draco Malfoy que voy a conocer en El Legado Maldito, si hubiera matado a Dumbledore?, Favorite HP book ever. So funny. So sad. So awesome. No more Hogwarts as I know it now, being as Dumbledore...ummmm.....Oh, look! It\\'s a bird! It\\'s a plane! No, it\\'s Hedwig! And she just...oh, yeah. Never mind. Yup, Hogwarts is definitely not the same..., One of my favorite Harry Potter books. I loved learning Voldemort\\'s history, the growing Ron/Hermione relationship, Harry crushing on Ginny, the battle at the end and the tragic end of Dumbledore. I remember after reading this book there was so much speculation among the fans about Snape. It was so much fun to discuss whether Snape was good or evil with other fans., It is much more exciting and more unique than the usual series after the 6th book. \\n I thought HP and the Order of the Phoenix will be, as supposed, much beautiful and exciting but that thought seems false. Read it and you\\'ll be dazzled once more. More love. More mysteries and more revelation. Can\\'t wait to read the last book.:D, I decided to reread this before seeing the movie. So far it is just as fun and clever as the first time. I admire Rowling immensely!, This was my favorite out of the series, I loved how everything started coming together in this book., I thought maybe I wouldn\\'t cry as much the second time around ... I was wrong., Reread 2011 \\n Reread 2016, The characters find love, Draco is a little prat, there was a war in the end, Dumbledore is sassy, pretty cray., Finally got around to finishing the series after a 2 year break between this book and book 5. I liked Harry\\'s journey with Dumbledore near the end of the book. The rest was just ok., reread, One of my new Favs!, After the last 2 books I wasn\\'t holding out for much but this started big, it ended big and didn\\'t let up much in between., Hmmm..speperti buku2 HP yg lalu2...seru dan menegangkan..plus lucu dan sukses membuat ku ketawa2 trus nangis2 sendiri..., This is my all time favorite Harry Potter book. There was just so much emotion in it. I read this book in like 2 days then went right back and started it again. \\n I used to reread this book all the time but since the last one came out and the disappointment from it, I just can\\'t make myself read these again. Which is very sad...., never pick up books that u find on the road u may not know who they belonged to before! \\n didn\\'t your mom warned you about it before?, Great Book!! I like how this book gives you more background on the Potters and Lord Voldemort. Like I remembered, the ending was very sad!!, rereading this book, so far, probably my top favourite. along side with the movie., Teeeen annngst., Reread in preparation for 7., Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter #6), by J.K. Rowling \\n and \\n Synopsis: The war against Voldemort is not going well; even Muggle governments are noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of the Daily Prophet, looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. \\n And yet... \\n As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate--and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. \\n So it\\'s the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here at Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort--and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability. \\n In A Sentence: My least favorite of the Harry Potter books, but still amazing \\n My Thoughts: This book is such a whirlwind of....everything! Out of the seven books, I like this one the least, but that doesn\\'t mean this book isn\\'t awesome, no siree. \\n Rowling did a great job depicting the life of a 16-year-old, I think. Their love lives, their attitudes, their opinions on what\\'s important, it was all in this novel, which is probably why this was my least favorite installment in the series (I\\'m not all that interested in teenage love stories, although some of these love stories were rather sweet). \\n While there was a decent amount of action in this novel, I think what makes this book so good was the psychology behind it. There\\'s the psychology of a teenager, there\\'s the psychology behind good people and villains, there\\'s even psychology surrounding Voldemort and his past, which I found interesting (I kept asking my psychologist husband \"Is Voldemort a sociopath or a psychopath?\") \\n Finally, there was that one part that, when I first read this, I couldn\\'t forgive Rowling for doing (if you\\'ve read this book, you know what I mean: that scene in the tower). In the final book, this part was satisfactorily explained, but I still hate the fact that the event happened! It was traumatic to read the first time around. Nowadays, I understand why it had to happen, but it still makes me very sad. \\n Overall, I loved the story, but I can\\'t say it was ever my favorite. It\\'s the transitory story between Harry Potter the Kid, and Harry Potter the Man, and, like all middle stories, leaves you unsatisfied and ready for the final epic conclusion!, I just died when Snape performed the \"Avada Kedavra\" spell and Dumbledore fell. I just cried. Then sobbed. And wailed. Five stars!, The Boy Who Lived returns to Hogwarts for the sixth year. Voldemort\\'s return is public knowledge, but he gathered power while the Ministry of Magic denied Dumbledore and Harry\\'s claims. The book opens with Severus Snape making a cryptic promise to Narcissa Malfoy, in a scene that sets the novel\\'s dark tone. \\n I will refrain from plot synopsis as many have already read the novel as well as its sequel. Instead, I\\'ll explain why I choose HBP for my first review. On my personal blog, I often mention books I\\'m reading, have read, or will read. The first book I offered in-depth commentary on was HBP, as soon as I finished it at 10:30 AM the day it came out. This review builds on that original commentary. I felt it fitting to use this book for my inaugural review. \\n Rowling has magic in her pen. Her prose may not always flow and some plot twists might be obvious, but few books are as fun to read as the Harry Potter series. Her Hogwarts imposes itself on the reader\\'s imagination - children across the world hope for an invitation on their eleventh birthdays. I devoured this and her other six books because she catches your attention and holds it. \\n Despite this, I feel Rowling became less descriptive in this entry. Some parts seem rushed and it damages her fantastic world-building. It also ensures that Harry seems blander. Most fans hate OoTP Harry. I, on the other hand, think it is his best incarnation. He\\'s temperamental, impulsive, hormonal, and often quite stupid. Rarely does an author write a teenager that perfectly. With this less emotional Harry, more emotional remove exist between the reader and his grief and crushes. \\n But while I feel remove from his crush, Rowling develops one relationship I hoped for in many of the previous books. She also, FINALLY, grants Draco Malfoy some character development. Long a fan favorite and a key figure in many of the best fanfictions, the Malfoy of the books left something to be desired. Namely, a third-dimension. DH does not focus on Malfoy, but it does continue this development with some wonderfully done scenes involving the entire family. \\n In the end, the flaws of HBP don\\'t matter. It\\'s the sixth book of the most popular series ever. The Harry Potter books may not be perfect, but they are something special., Snape and Voldemort was the focus of this book and it was just about time. Harry is learning more about Voldemort\\'s past so that he can figure out a weakness somehow or a mistake that he might have done. This is in preparation for the...end., this was the best in the series., I don\\'t think I like the direction this points for the 7th book. At this point, I\\'m sort of over Harry Potter. Also, I kind of thought Snape was hot. Whatevs., Just as entertaining and heart-wrenching the 3rd time through., Another re-read for me, as the kids and I are doing the entire series aloud. \\n Just as the Star Wars film series has its Empire Strikes Back, the Harry Potter series has its Half-Blood Prince. The twin tragedies of Snape\\'s seeming betrayal and Dumbledore\\'s death make this one a difficult read (especially when you have to explain it to a pair of seven-year-olds). But it\\'s a satisfying move forward in terms of the development of Harry\\'s character, which changes from the sullen teenager of the prior book into something a bit more complex and manly. It\\'s a nice set-up for the grand finale and despite its length was a faster, more compelling read than its predecessor in the series., Well, it\\'s easy to see why I\\'ve read this one so much less than the others. It is a heartbreaker, and not easier to get through for knowing it\\'s coming., So good; so emotionally devastating. One more to reread for book club and I know I will be a wreck after Deathly Hallows., Very interesting insight into some of the supporting characters., I\\'m more than half-way through and am just now getting into this one. Either having the flu has slowed things down for me, or I\\'m just having a hard time that they\\'re all growing up ... \\n ---------------------------------------------------------------- \\n It\\'s strange to me that I was almost finished this book and to the part of this book where Dumbledore dies, as my own father was dying. I consider my Dad my hero, my walking encyclopedia, the most intelligent and gentle giant of a person I\\'ve ever known, much like Dumbledore. This book will have much significance to me now., Abi said she was going to give it 700 stars but she had to take away 696 stars for the death at the end so she gave it four. I stick with five., Yep.... it was just as good this time as it was the first. On to book 7 for the second time... :o) \\n Ok, so I am reading this book again because I knew they left so much stuff out of the movie. Since I have now seen the movie twice, I decided it was best if I read the book again to fill in the gaps that the movie left. I have to say, I\\'m really enjoying this book, especially since it\\'s been a few years sice the last time I read it., I\\'ve read this book a few times now, it really explains voldermorts past, starting to gear up for the last book!, Re-read 9/11/2012, A great book. Kinda slow in the center-ish area, but the ending was intense and to the point. Remarkable!, A plot twist I didn\\'t expect, what a delight!, The funny thing about the Harry Potter series is that, no matter how I enjoy the books while reading them, somehow they don\\'t leave any strong impression to me. Maybe I should rummage my bookshelves again, find them, and try to revive the happy memories. Then I can write more appropriate reviews for the series, and probably change my ranking which at the moment stays at the safe \\'3 stars out of 5\\'. \\n AS for this book, like my sister said, \"It\\'s got a lot of Snape in it\", so I think it has its own merit that it deserves 4 stars instead of 3 like the other books (haha, yes, sorry)., I love Harry Potter so deeply I can\\'t even explain it. So much happens in this book, my heart is feeling all the feels, I was crying some minutes ago. GOSH I NEED A HUG. \\n And as always, I just have to say it: Hagrid is perfection, what a precious character, he makes my heart melt, I adore him so so so much., 2nd best HP book After the prisoner of Azkaban ! \\n I enjoyed every word in it ,, specially Voldemort\\'s history, Vua doc xong lai cuon Harry Potter va Hoang Tu Lai, co le la lan thu muoi may, hai chuc roi cung nen.

But I was ok with that because I was able to pick up the next book and start reading!, Awesome! More complicated and intriguing than other Harry Potter\\'s books. Cant wait for the next and last book of Harry Potter!, A photo posted by Kerry Callaway (@kerrycallaway) on Jan 27, 2016 at 12:51pm PST, This book was all about relationships ... and not just the massive amount of snogfests going on either. Deep relationships, like the one that develops between Dumbledore and Harry and peripheral relationships like the one between Mrs. Weasley and her soon-to-be daughter-in-law Phlegm (er...Fleur) and Lupin and Tonks. I really liked that aspect of the book. But, I must admit, even though I know how it turns out - I hate Snape in this book, I hate him so GD much!, Incredible. Amazing. Took my breath away. Unlike everything I\\'ve ever read. Fantastic world. \\n I especially liked the change of relationship between Ron and Hermione. They were so funny and sweet by moments. They are my favorite couple in the series, by the way. :D, Seru! Jadi lebih tahu sisi lain dari You Know Who.., First Goodreads Reading: March 26-27, 2014, Story is still \"...\" (too much of a set-up for the seventh book), but I enjoyed the translation., One of the best!, Very enjoyable read. A setup for book seven., 3 RTCs in a row! I am drowning!, For my fellow Harry Potter fans [?]- I\\'ve been reading the books then watching the movies with Kenzie and we just finished Year 6, The Half Blood Prince. I know the 7th book is split into two movies- my question is do I read the entire book then watch both movies or read to the split and watch the first movie etc? We have LOVED this series so far and I\\'m honestly a little sad to end it., AMAZING!!!! CAN\\'T PUT IN WORDS!!!!, I just reread this one, and it\\'s sooo good! I cried for over an hour at that one part... no spoilers here!, I daresay the movie is completely nothing compared to the book., Probably my favorite installment in the series, although Goblet of Fire is a close second. \\n Feels poignant. Didn\\'t expect the death of Dumbeldore to come as such a great shock after seeing the picture. That\\'s one of the take-aways I guess, that the book is always, more often than not, better than the movie., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Wow! I did not see Dumbledore\\'s death coming! And even after it happened, I found myself being optimistic and thinking that he couldn\\'t REALLY be dead. Then Sophie reminded me that I had the same exact reaction when Sirius died, and he was REALLY dead. I\\'m holding out that there will be some way that Dumbledore comes back to give Harry some sort of message or bit of encouragement in the final book., 05/06/2016 \\n First book I\\'m changing the rating for during this series re-read. I wish I\\'d written a review last time, because I don\\'t actually remember why I only gave this 3 stars before? It was my lowest personal rating of any book in the series, and I\\'ve also always considered it to be my least favourite of all the books. Which is...puzzling, I guess, because I really enjoyed it this time around. \\n As with Order of the Phoenix, I\\'d forgotten a lot of the details but I just flew through it this week. \\n I can only assume that a big part of my somewhat lower rating was the whole Harry/Ginny thing, which ... well, let\\'s be honest, I\\'m never going to be a fan of them but I\\'ve mostly gotten past it. Oddly enough, I never shipped anyone the first time around, and that hasn\\'t changed. I don\\'t have any particularly strong feelings towards any of the couples. I would\\'ve preferred, for instance, Harry/Ron/Hermione to just stay best friends all their lives, without any couples being formed within their little group. If I absolutely HAD to choose between wanting Ron/Hermione and Harry/Hermione as a romantic pairing, I would have to choose the latter. But even so, it wouldn\\'t be wholeheartedly; I all prefer them as friends. \\n Mostly because, in my opinion, Rowling\\'s strong suit just isn\\'t romance. I\\'m not swooned by the way she writes it and I know we were supposed to believe that Ginny\\'s crush on Harry had just been put on the back-burner all these years, but as a result of the way she wrote it, I just didn\\'t buy it. This was less of an issue for Ron and Hermione, but honestly, Harry seems to notice Ginny from one day to the next (goodye, Cho!) and then Ginny suddenly reveals she never really stopped hoping and lol, no. \\n But anyway, as I said before I\\'ve made my peace with it (or I\\'ve tried) and it bothered me less this time. \\n I love this book for so many reasons - first and foremost the further character development, which really does seem to get better with each book - and the ending didn\\'t fail to turn me into a blubbering mess again. \\n Out of all the deaths in these books, Dumbledore\\'s will always hit me the hardest. I may have cried less than I did the first time, but cry I did. I was being strong, up until the point where Harry follows McGonagall into Dumbledore\\'s office and there\\'s a new portrait on the wall, with the old Headmaster snoozing peacefully. I lost it, then. He is without a doubt one of my favourite characters, because he is all that is good in the world and yet Rowling made him flawed as well and I just. I LOVE HIM A LOT, OKAY. \\n There was more I wanted to say, but I\\'ve forgotten it all in light of the ending. \\n *Read: April 2011, June 2016, J. K. as that from the very beginning knew how to finish the book...:) It is perhaps for the kids, but maybe not. I found it in the answers to many things. I think it is every fantastic detail in the book can be connected with a thing in real life. Think about it!, HP makes great strides in understanding his enemy & thus understanding himself. His growing relationship with Dumbledore is also inspiring. For theological comments on HP & other fantasy writers see http://bit.ly/UTC3dy, \"It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world.\" \\n Great addition to an outstanding series. Harry and the gang are growing and learing more and more about Harry\\'s History as well as some pretty deep stuff concerning Snape. \\n Amazing Series., I think this one was my favorite one from the series, and I am really interested to see what they will do for the movie (which I\\'m frustrated to say won\\'t come out in Nov, but in July 2009)., The end broke my heard even more than the Order of the Phoenix! Loved this book!, I enjoyed a lot of the background information given in this story, and I loved how much time Harry was able to spend with Dumbledore. That ending though, made me tear up for the first time in the books and IT JUST WASN\\'T RIGHT, OKAY???, Gets me every time. Chills, tears, hope..., I LOVE these books -- but that said, my favorites are the first few, before things start getting so very very dark., I loved Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I loved the whole series, except perhaps the last book - but this one was my favorite. Upon finishing it, it seemed to me that the whole book had been carefully crafted so that the main events of the book could actually be interpreted multiple ways, leading to very different possible interpretations of what actually happened, and why. I spun all sorts of fanciful interpretations of what had happened, and all sorts of fanciful conjectures of what would happen in the next book. That\\'s quite a challenge, and it was executed brilliantly. It was very satisfying - even though I was not particularly pleased with the way things actually wrapped up in the final book. \\n I loved Rowling\\'s ability to make every character (and there are many) memorable throughout the whole series. I loved how - in retrospect - she had things worked out several books in advance, down to even small details. I loved how nicely the balance is kept between gripping danger and age-appropriateness. I loved the imaginativeness of the spell names and the ways spells worked. The same goes for magical objects and magical creatures. I thought her prose was consistently interesting and entertaining. While some might think poorly of reading books for younger readers, I thought the whole series was quite mature in terms of the great themes of personal growth, friendship, doing what\\'s right, putting others before yourself, and so on. The only things that were to my distaste were: (1) Harry was too passive and reactive for my tastes. He was adrift in the circumstances of his life, rather than at the helm controlling their direction. I would rather a more proactive protagonist. (2) He would repeatedly solve problems by having a fit, doing something dumb, and then being saved by great luck. I would\\'ve preferred if he solved problems by thinking up great strategies and executing them well. I wanted him to succeed based upon the merit of his actions, rather than upon miraculous chance. Normally, those two issues would detract from the series quite significantly, but in this case, everything else was so good that I could mostly gloss over those issues., I liked the entire series, even with them getting darker toward the end., Very detailed though less action pact. Still a wonderful Harry Potter book., The saddest book of the series. One of the most important legacy of Dumbeldore is the faith in ability to love and to be loved as the most important thing that distinguish Voldemort and Harry. The very same thing that will lead Harry to the victory at the end., Yes, Brad and I are still reading this book. It takes us a long time!, OH MY FUCKING GOD. This book really messed with the feels. I just... I can\\'t. Why you do this to me, Rowling? :\\'( :\\'( :\\'(, Obviously I love this book and have read it tons of times, but one thing I got out of it this time was the kindness of Dumbledore to Draco at the end. He earnestly tried to save Draco\\'s soul and to save his family, despite all the Malfoys had done, Dumbledore offered mercy and a second chance., Read first in 2009 - obviously, Old review I wrote on my blog (http://douglascootey.com) on 21 November 2005: \\n Last summer I waited in line with my daughters for the most eagerly anticipated book of the year: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The book was well worth the wait. It was the best written since Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I pegged some events correctly and was surprised by others. I found the book entertaining, and would even recommend it to non-Harry Potter fans as a place to start the series. I\\'m going to be discussing some plot spoilers in this review so if that sort of thing bothers you you\\'ve just read my review in a nutshell and don\\'t need to read further. \\n I had problems with Book Four, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Although I enjoyed much of what happened in the book the ending nearly killed me. Once we learned that Barty Crouch Jr. was posing as Moody we were treated to a full chapter of exposition as he recounted the entire story all over again, but from his point of view. I found it dreadfully dull and often skipped through it. Only this year did I learn that JK Rowling enjoys Dorothy Sayers and that Goblet of Fire\\'s ending fit the classic Sayers\\' style ending. \\n I had problems with Book Five, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, as well. I found it overly long at times and in need of a good edit. Interestingly, JK Rowling felt the same. \\n \"There are bits of all six books that I would go back and tighten up. My feeling is that Phoenix is overlong, but I challenge anyone to find the obvious place to cut.\" \\n This isn\\'t to say that I didn\\'t enjoy those books. I\\'ve read them so many times I\\'ve lost count. I\\'m just saying that these books had flaws in execution and length. The same couldn\\'t be said for Book Six, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. This is the tightest book she\\'s written to date. The narrative was woven well. The characters were well fleshed out, there weren\\'t any personality changes pulled out of a hat like Ginny\\'s character in Book Five, and the back story balanced well with current events. Not only did we see an end to CAPS LOCK Harry, but exposition was much improved from earlier books. Instead of having the story explained from the mouths of Hermione, Dumbledore, or Crouch, we had pensieve episodes which worked much better in my opinion, proving the old writer\\'s adage: \"Show it, don\\'t tell it.\" This was a well written adventure story. \\n Interestingly, I had three predictions proven to be true, which is good even for me. First, Dumbledore died, paving the way for Harry to finally stand on his own. Until now, and as Harry himself had pointed out in Book Five, he\\'s been very lucky and always saved by somebody else. Now there will be no teachers to rescue him. No guardian angels waiting in the wings. Our hero cannot be a hero until he fights insurmountable odds on his own. Second, we discovered the horcruxes. I had predicted a few years ago, based on events in Book Two, that Voldemort had obtained immortality by imbuing inanimate objects with his soul, as he had done with the dairy. I was delighted to be right about this one, and the third prediction: that it would be too much to expect the horcruxes to be laying about Hogwarts so Harry would have to go on a quest to find them. There are still mysteries to be revealed in Book Seven, such as the importance of Harry\\'s green eyes and how that relates to Lilly, his mother, or what significance his scar has yet to play beyond it\\'s iconic purposes. Book Six tied up enough loose ends to satisfy, but left enough untied to keep the reader looking forward to the next installment. \\n Much has been made of how dark this book is compared to the others. I\\'m not sure where people\\'s heads have been. Harry Potter and the Sorceror\\'s Stone started with murder, abandonment, and child abuse. It was garnished with bullying, hinted with dark disembodied cloaks that fed on fresh unicorn blood, then topped with life threatening trials and ordeals. And that was all before facing the grand baddie himself. All that has changed is Harry has grown up, gone through his angry teenage years and now is ready to be a man. The framework for this was laid in the first book for this progression, but the books have always been dark. \\n As for romances, much has been made about them as well, but JKR will not be known as a great romance novelist. The \"romance\" in the books is, as we Americans would put it, High School stuff. Meeting at lockers, making out in the equipment room, etc. No surprise there. They\\'re still students. We have yet to see if Harry and Ginny have the greatest written love scenes of teen fiction yet to come. In fact, I suspect that it is quite plausible for Ginny to die, sacrificing herself and protecting Harry with the same charm his mother once used on him, but I\\'m not holding my breath. The romance will be there, but secondary to the action and adventure experienced by our hero, Harry Potter. It is his story, told through his eyes, and unless Harry suddenly becomes a hopeless romantic the story\\'s narrative will focus on the same elements it always has. Could a Harry Potter fan ask for anything more?, This book made me love Dumbledore even more...and then the ending. Kills me every time., I feel depressed., My appreciation for this sixth book in the series has grown since the last time I read it. It\\'s a much tighter story than I remembered, and the lead up to the tragic ending is a lot more evident on a second reading. I think a lot of what confused me about it now is the flashback scenes told in the Pensieve. I don\\'t think I quite grasped what was going on the first time, and I\\'m really not sure why, because it\\'s not a terribly difficult plot when you get right down to it. \\n In any case, I found myself reading a lot faster and absorbing a lot more of the mythology behind Voldemort\\'s rise to power this time, and bits of Deathly Hallows are actually clearer now that I\\'ve gone back and re-read this one. \\n There\\'s also a sense of urgency to this novel that the fourth and fifth books seemed to lack. This book doesn\\'t meander, it knows where it\\'s going and what it\\'s leading to, and I really appreciate that about this book., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I\\'m having difficulty trying to take myself back into this book, because I just finished The Darkest Minds by Alexandra Bracken like fifteen minutes ago, so. \\n Oh, okay. I think I\\'m there. \\n I loved that Dumbledore played a more important role in this book, and how he answers a lot of our questions. (For instance: why can\\'t anyone hold the Defense Against the Dark Arts position for more than a year? Oh, Voldemort cursed it. Gotcha.) \\n I don\\'t know how a feel about the new Minister of Magic. I think he\\'s a lot better than Fudge, but isn\\'t seeing the big picture. It makes sense to not like him, but I\\'m hoping he just leaves Harry alone in the last book. \\n Horcruxes. WHO THE HECK IS THE ASSHOLE WHO DECIDED TO TAKE THE HORCRUX AND REPLACE IT WITH A FAKE ONE?! We needed that horcrux MUCH MORE than he did! I was so upset when that piece of information presented itself. Dumbledore suffered for nothing. \\n I always thought that Harry was a little in the wrong to have this intense hatred towards Snape. Book six sure did change that very quickly. I was always hoping that Snape would find a way to redeem himself, but he did just the opposite. In killing Dumbledore, he killed one of the last shreds of hope for the wizarding community and I was hella pissed. \\n I sobbed at Dumbledore\\'s funeral. \\n And I just need to talk about Ron and Lavender. \\n Hilarious. Ohmygod. \\n I still find it a little weird that these little boy and girl wizards are all flirty and stuff, but that\\'s only because they\\'re all still twelve in my eyes. \\n Overall: excellent and tear-inducing. I\\'ll start the last installment later today., I\\'ve given all the other Harry Potter novels pretty much five stars but this one definitely deserved all of them. There was something going throughout the whole book and it was exciting and fun and intense. There was so many things in this one. \\n Love it!, Reread 2017. Fav, so far this one has been my favorite book in the series, I gave this 3 stars originally but really it does deserve four. I think I was a little overly emotional and annoyed at JK Rowling when I finished it. Wow.That\\'s all I can say, really. It still hurts to think about it haha., R.I.P. Albus. Say it ain\\'t so Severus!, Ummm... I have to catch up with my 11 year old., My review of the audiobook version, Mourning Period, what? was all i could think about. I got so lost in what was going on that i really didnt understand it. This book was good but i think i better read it one more time just so i can understand it a bit better, Oh my Lord, what is Snape up to?, Wow. This is intensely dark and terrible and I loved every minute of it. Diving deep into the history of Voldemort I personally found deeply intriguing and despite this being one of my least read Potter books, it is now my favorite. \\n Also Snape is a dick no matter what and Dumbledore also kinda sucks., 2nd favourite, now I\\'m sure., Review from re-read in 2009: \\n I\\'d forgotten how much fun this book is. I say fun, despite the last four or five chapters. The interaction between Harry, Hermione, and Ron was interesting and fun, especially the growing romantic dynamic between Hermione and Ron. Harry falling for Ginny, and his twisting emotions regarding \\'bros before hos\\' was good to read. \\n The memories are, point blank, the best part of the book. The look into Voldemort\\'s past, and Harry\\'s reaction to how he lived and seeing the similarities between the two of them, were the perfect way to bring in facts about Voldemort without getting boring. \\n The final scenes were amazing. The first one that I loved was Draco vs Dumbledore. The emotion coming from Malfoy were heart wrenching, and Dumbledore slowly losing strength and slipping down the wall just squeezed the heart to pieces. \\n My favorite scene, and to be honest, the scene I was most looking forward to in the movie (NOT BITTER), was the final scene between Snape and Harry. Harry freaking out and throwing out a Crucio curse, then attempting Snape\\'s own spells on him, and Snape\\'s overwhelming fury. We\\'d never seen Snape lose it up to that point, it was always cold and quiet anger. For him to lose his shit so completely and proclaim himself the HBP was just amazing. \\n I\\'m now itching to re-read book 7 after this. Ahhh, HP. How I miss you., Even though I was expecting, almost cried..., Ahh finished in the wee hours of the morning! I LOVE IT! Totally unspoiled going into the last book...gotta read fast!, SIRIUS BLACK, The 6th of 7 in an amazing series. Not the least bit overrated., I re-read this in anticipation of seeing the film. \\n What can one say. The saga continues. The best aspect of this for me was the characterization of adolescence. I thought she hit a home run with that. Harry is a flawed hero, more than willing to take a short cut to help his grades, even if that means possible corruption. Ron and Hermione play sexual tennis, both wanting the other but neither able to take a direct approach. Harry is interested in Ginny, but takes a very Peter Parker role at the end in rejecting her for her own safety. The identity of the Half-blood prince is revealed at the end and provides a nifty twist. We are also strung along with the question of whether Snape is or isn\\'t working for the dark side. \\n Is Dumbledore really gone, or has he found a way to preserve a portion of his soul by arranging his own death? There are talismans that are left unanalyzed that will no doubt provide the roots of the final book. It was a very enjoyable ride in the classic series of our time. \\n A small pet peeve is that I think poor Ron deserves better than to be the ever-present comic relief., December 2016. Re-reading( buddy read), My 8 year old son has started reading the Harry Potter series, so I re-read this book and was swept back into Hogwarts and Harry\\'s wizardly world.I had forgotten a lot of the detail, especially the detail which didn\\'t make it into the movie and enjoyed this one, more than #5. Dumbledore\\'s death is a shocking scene, made me remember my astonishment when I read this part the first time round. Very intense in places, like the cave, so I think we\\'ll make my son wait a couple years before getting this far in the series., Loved this book. It helped to pull together the pieces to understand the big picture. I can\\'t believe what happened! I am now quickly on the to the 7th book!!, Even though I knew what was coming, even though I remembered this book much better than the others, I still couldn\\'t put it down. The relationship between Dumbledore and Harry is probably my favorite in the whole series, to say nothing of the character of Dumbledore himself. I find the scenes between the two of them, which drive much of this novel, to be some of Rowling\\'s best writing. Slughorn\\'s good fun too., Reread with the audio book. Just as brilliant as the first time., As horrible as it seems to sound Tom Riddle, aka Lord Voldemort, has to be one of my favorite characters of all time. He\\'s a baddy, yes. He tries to kill off--and in some cases succeeded in doing so--some of the most beloved characters in this series, yes. However, his story and history is so amazingly developed that it has become an impossibility for me not to love this character. It\\'s a guilty pleasure. This book might as well consist entirely of Voldemort\\'s history, or a great deal of it anyhow, and for that I love it. Well done, Rowling! Beaten only by Order of the Phoenix, and that was by barely., Exact rating: 4.75 \\n I didn\\'t like this as much but it was still BRILLIANT. But in the mean time, I\\'ve so much hate for this book, Dumbledore, Snape, Malfoy. \\n I\\'ve literally never hated anybody as much as I\\'ve hated Snape in my 17 years of living. How dare he, that fucking son of a shit. \\n Half blood prince? More like prince of garbage. And... and how can Rowling kill Dumbledore? *sobs* I knew he\\'d die but I didn\\'t expect it to be effing Malfoy. I didn\\'t think I\\'ll cry when Dumbledore died, honestly, I didn\\'t fancy his character that much but the impact was bigger than expected. My heart breaks for everybody at Hogwarts. This is too much for me to express my feelings. \\n I just can\\'t this is unacceptable., gah. I\\'m heartbroken and cried like a baby but it was so good. so so good., I never been so attached in a book before. I mean yes, I cried in some books, but not like this. The loss makes me feel like I\\'m really a part of the story. like i\\'m part of the journey, the death of dumbledore makes me feel like me too lose him. like we share a moment together. I can\\'t believe im grieving the death of a fictional character seriously. i never been so attached before, like this. and I feel so sorry for Harry, its really not fair for him to have a life like that, he deserve more. I also love hermione and ron for sticking to harry together. They\\'re really a true friend, I wish I had them. and ginny, for being so understanding and all. i\\'m so sad..., can\\'t still believe in Dambldor\\'s death!!!!!!!!!!, Another solid book of storytelling. The different plot lines weave together smoothly and compliment each other in terms of relevancy and interest. \\n After watching the movie of this book, I concluded that I actually like the romance of Ginny and Harry much much better in the book. It\\'s sweeter and not as much of a surprise. They have longer to be together and that is nice, and Ginny, for some reason to me, is cooler in the book than she is in the movie. She\\'s the popular one while Harry is the well known one, which is slightly different than being popular. \\n I continue to like this book very much and realize that things about the horcruxes and such make way more sense to me now. Not sure why - maybe I just read the book too fast the first time around., Not a lot of modern \"teen\" books are that great, but I can honestly say that I\\'m glad Harry Potter is a phenomenon. This is a great and pretty original fantasy series with a great plot, surprisingly believable characters, and a fantastic spin on the \"going to school\" type of teen novels. Enjoyed this series a lot as a whole, and while the first two books move slower than the rest, it pays off and the series gets more harrowing, fun, and intense as it progresses., so emotional and sad, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I wrote the following for my blog shortly after finishing the book in April 2007: \\n I have to say that the story kept me intrigued from the beginning. I was carried from chapter to chapter with ease and, of course, the well known characters and well defined plot had a lot to do with this. \\n Right, if you haven\\'t read the book, then I strongly advise you to stop reading this post right NOW!! \\n Now I can get into the juice of this book. Whilst I really did enjoy it, I was totally disappointed with Dumbledore\\'s death. It wasn\\'t so much that he died (that alone did upset me though), it was how he died. He was meant to be a great wizard, and he was killed without the big battle I would have expected from such an important character. I realise Dumbledore had already consumed all that liquid from the bowl in the cave, which made him weak, but still...it felt totally wrong. He should have gone out in glory, but no...it makes me so angry. \\n I can\\'t say I\\'m surprised that Snape was the one who killed Dumbledore. I am, however, left feeling confused as to which side Snape is really on. Of course, that is the author\\'s intention. I believe she wants us to finally conclude that Snape is bad, but the events will continue to unravel and show Snape to be good in the end. The fact that Snape killed Dumbledore is hard to get around. Dumbledore pleading with Snape is still clear in my mind. But, on the other hand, Dumbledore trusted Snape 100% and I somehow can\\'t accept Dumbledore being wrong in that judgement. To be honest, if it turns out Snape is actually on Harry\\'s side, there better be an extremely good reason for Dumbledore\\'s death. \\n I am also unhappy about the hint that the seventh book will be taken away from Hogwarts. A friend said \"Hogwarts is as much a main character as Harry is\" and I agree totally. The school, the teachers, the other students, even the quidditch (which I hate reading about and won\\'t miss for a second) are combined to make the books what they are. To take the final year of the story away from all that is wrong. Besides, should books that are read by the millions of school aged children and young adults be allowed to promote leaving school early? Definitely not. \\n And lastly, the romance between Harry and Ginny - it was the one thing I really did not like throughout the entire book. It happened too suddenly and, although Ginny \"liked\" Harry from the start of the series, the romance didn\\'t sit right with me. It felt rushed and convenient. Some people think Hermione is more Harry\\'s type. Perhaps she is, but if she ends up with Harry instead of Ron, I\\'ll be bitterly disappointed., I think j.k rowling is the real witch and she wrote this book with her wand because her writing \\n is magic., The worst of the Potter books so far. It\\'s far to long, in such a way that the reader can point out exactly the endless paragraphs which just shouldn\\'t be there. Didn\\'t like the added drama tone. I liked more the light tales of all the previous books. This one is just not fun anymore. Glad there is only one more to read, because I am afraid I couldn\\'t take much more of this new Rowling approach to Potter., Dumbledoreeee, Worth the wait, however was lacking some of the depth of previous books, There are only two words that can describe this book...absolutely fabulous!, Sweet...as you can tell I\\'m running out of things to say about Harry Potter..., Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is where J.K. Rowling was able to truly humanize the characters. Harry, Ron and Hermione are not only heroes but they are also teens with hormones and a lot of angst. Lord Voldemort had not always been bad (okay, he was always that bad) but before he became The Dark Lord, he was also Tom Riddle. And, Dumbledore though great and wise is also vincible and human., I think learning about Voldemort\\'s past was really interesting as well as the part of Snape killing Dumbledore. I thought if Dumby would die, he would go out in style or something., This had always been one of my faves in the series when I was younger, and I am happy to say that this is still one of my faves now too!!!! \\n Also I\\'ve been trying, throughout this whole series, to understand people who like Snape and justify his actions for everything, but honestly he\\'s just a horrible person., I have all the feels., *heart breaks into a thousand tiny pieces*, Chapter 26 (the cave) was my favorite chapter out of all the books so far. The imagery was awesome. It reminded me a lot of the Hobbit when Bilbo meets Gollum., I was crying while reading Dumbledore\\'s death., Wow. J. K. Rowling is such an amazing writer. Her characters spring to life with force... and this installment in the HP series is no different. I know that I am probably the only person on earth who is just now getting around to finishing this series... and that\\'s OK with me. I knew the key plot points going into the book and I have to say that knowing has given me a new perspective on some of the characters. But as always, Rowling\\'s work is delightful and horrifying and wonderful and I am on to number 7., read this review and others at http://readingforsanity.blogspot.com/..., 31/2 stars, rounded up to 4. Compared to the last two, it\\'s just seems more... mundane? prosaic? Still really enjoyed it (and was reading it 3 + 4 chapters at a time...) and/but/so brief anecdote: \\n I\\'ve never read this series. My son (currently 51/2 as I write this) received the first book for Christmas 2012. So we\\'ve been reading them aloud together. As of Christmas 2013, we had read the first 3 books, and then he received the entire collection as a gift. So we read book 4. And as his dad I thought to myself: well that got dark in a hurry. And I figured maybe it was too frightening for him, or at least too heavy. But he insisted he could take it. And that he wanted to advance to book 5. So we did, and though it wasn\\'t necessarily darker (because the surprise death of Cedric is still pretty much the pivotal moment in the series, in my opinion), when we reached the end of #5, he told me that it had \"scary parts\" and that he wanted me to read ahead to make sure it wasn\\'t too scary. Anyway, I\\'m glad he did, because there were a few little bits in here that would be tough for him to digest. So there\\'s that., i really liked this HP book alot!, co-dependency might be an unhealthy foundation for a relationship, but if our addictions are complementary, shucks, I\\'ll have no problem spinning this out forever. or, like, irony time? \\n that bag I sold you yesterday was short? what you on, cra... oh wait. right. well, I don\\'t sell slim bags baby. that bag was phat. this bag gonna be even more phat. focus on what you got. \\n oh man, I guess these sorts of drug pictures and references have to end eventually. that and Captain Crunch will get us everything. but, of course I can\\'t help but repeat \\n BFA \\n Bachelor of \\n Fine \\n Arts \\n means addiction equals ability. I really really can spin out 10000 characters a day indefinitely. and wherever it goes, it probably won\\'t end up in a breach, but then maybe it will. unfortunately, since the single applauding audience member is declining to provide direct feedback about the text provided, we\\'re left with the mere repetition of certain tired tropes. as in, \"textual healing,\" \"safe text,\" \"text before marriage,\" \"text in the morning,\" whatever. any halfwit (self) can crack halfjokes all night long. BFA burn baby burn. \\n in all seriousness though, without direct commentary on the subject at hand, the default subject will continue to be the nature of art itself, the secrets of art, the inner world of musicians or whatnot, at least as spied out by a reasonable competent outsider. what this means is the old undergraduate conversation of \"what were we 15000 years ago?\" answer: Tukk, Fjik, Reek, and Jjek-- preverbal, nomadic people who followed buffalo herds and chased mammoths, existing in tribes of about 150 people, no more. hence, our current evolved human mental limit of 150 personalities. \\n now \"the first profession\" is immediately known. the second arrives after some thought. (rot13: rfcvbantr). But what is the third profession of humanity ? \\n answer: S H A M A N! \\n available genetic evidence suggests that between 1-2% of human beings are born as shaman, inclined to wear bird feathers and chant weirdly haunting songs. then, this profession evolved through ancient greece into the dramatic and lyrical arts, the historian (bleh), the musician. and today musicians are still amongst us today, looking at us, checking us out, and discussing us within their own enclosed worlds. \\n I completely stand by my claim that KPP\\'s INVADER carries the subliminal message of INDIE POP; viz., Yasutaka Nakata is deliberately trying to get Tokyo (and other Japanese cities\\') indie pop musicians, mostly early 20 something and at art colleges, on his side. pretty tricky. the relationship in Western settings tends to be, well, more adversarial. in fact, I believe there are currently open law suits regarding the practice of \"sampling,\" which the Supreme Court no less settled in favour of the big name rather than the little guy. this despite the fact that the little guys are like 300 rappers and hip hop artists in the Dirty South or in NYC whose hooks were basically just lifted by a record label rhyming with Mef Kam. how\\'s that for intra-artist battles. \\n this is kind of why the 2013 battle between carpet bombers, goodreaders, the \"management,\" the enforcers, whoever carries a tinge of interest as an object of study itself. I mean, who exactly is battling but a very limited circle of book devotees. the entire \"GR reviewer elite\" is like 200 people. what this results in is what political scientist Samuel Huntington called \"the super-empowered individual.\" the Internet has released certain economies of scale and certain network effects, hence, actually 20 organized GR reviewers actually probably shake things up--- if only for the fact that unity is actually pretty difficult to achieve. Mass sentiment, of course, in the end is in favour of the resistance forces, but there are walls that do not breach easily. they exist. \\n does this make more or less sense without coming off legalistic? I\\'m reading John Grisham right now... thoughts all in legal worlds... but the banking sector recently did me a good turn and fedex\\'d me a replacement card across the Pacific. so it\\'s not always chaos, and it\\'s not always Filipino CSRs answering phones to argue with the Japanese teller girl right in front of your face... \\n KPP in any case, continues to blast from speakers off Center-Gai, and in Shinjuku settings as well. somebody opened the lower drawers at the BOOKOFF (that name is not a typo, nor is their brief corporate cousin, the HARDOFF, *cough*), and aesthetic analysis had to be forced on that issue as well, as Japanese commentary on sandaled feet gave way to the rush of traffic, the speeding kei-trucks, the observation that we might all be getting way too far ahead of ourselves with the references that can\\'t be referenced. and I thought also of the Pennsylvania reviewer with his footnotes: at once a part of the Diaz tradition; at another remove, just part of the whole US thing. \\n but that\\'s the whole problem, right? do we ever know ourselves? \\n ---------------------------------- \\n I could comment more on aesthetics so I guess I am forced to in a sense. overall people agree that Japanese aesthetics are superior to even many Western cultural models. late 15th century Japanese logos look like modern 2014 variants; there are costumes preserved from 11th century Japanese naval fleets that would not look horrible worn today on a Paris street. in contrast, Sino aesthetics are considered overly cloying, sweet, colorful. yet the SIno response is to claim a deeper Wu/Satori; a greater connection to the Tianxia/Daishi concept. we\\'ll have to leave that for another day. \\n the other flip side of aesthetics, of course, is also, does superior aesthetics compensate for lack of morality? if I viciously beat a hapless 12 year old in the head for the laughs, should I receive a shorter prison sentence if I did so with a giant pink alligator? questions, even entire classroom discussions, can be molded on this topic, but in any case, it is 12:45am in the morning and I don\\'t want the brain to sound too sleep addled. \\n -------------------- \\n better to jump around and say... C A M D E N T I M E S H A R E!! ha, we can\\'t leave that. suffice to say Etienne has not been around lately but Nadine threw me a possibly passionate look. small girl doesn\\'t care two figs about me, but African boy toy possibly made an ambiguously ambiguous remark. then there\\'s the relatively ineffectual French boys, who are not really participating heavily in social affairs. and that leads, of course, to the repetition of the larger unchallenged point \\n \"in global settings, English boys are favoured over English girls, but French girls are favoured over French boys.\" \\n hmm... do the accusations of prejudice fly yet? and if we mind-experimented the idea of a fashionable dinner party with French girls and English girls, are we absolutely absolutely sure the most desirable girl present would be French? Girls Aloud would disagree... I\\'ll go out on a limb though and point out that ROMANCE cultures might be argued as more feminine, evocative, instinctual; GERMANIC cultures more logical, cold, masculine, reserved. we are, unfortunately, GERMAN. we may have been conquered by the Normans in 1066, but that was almost a thousand years ago. Pig and Whistle. Elephant and Castle. \\n because of our own Germanic nature, what we can\\'t realize about ourselves is how oppressive our own existence is to everyone else. that\\'s why I can\\'t complete sympathies for our government\\'s stance in Eastern Europe, where Anglo-Americans and the EU seem to be bandwagoning together... hmm... this is probably a topic for a whole another day, but, hey, Russians can be odd, but some of them can be all right. if that makes me a polar bear, why bark bark bark/ \\n other random animal encounters: cats mostly, some ravens, foot-stomping in Ravenspot. Rvaenspot= hidden double secret location in Yoyogi park, once you find it, you\\'ll know. maybe the precise \\n PSYCHOGEOGRAPHIC \\n centre of the Shinjuku-Shibuya axis. and maybe Harajuku is centre BECAUSE Shimo-kitazawa is to the west, Shin-okubo to the north, Aoyama to the east (fantastic planned architecture), and Meguro to the south. in other words, not just a fashionable neighborhood, but a fashionable series of neighborhoods surrounded each in turn by other fashionable meccas. and yes, I\\'m rambling, but I\\'m rambling if you get what I mean, and psychogeography is oh-so-hot these days isn\\'t it. a science before its time. a French specialty too, I believe. \\n doobie-doobie-doo... feel free to specify what you... \\n [want] \\n in general particularistic terms, the miyashita railway park (a copycat of the high line?) represents a great insider\\'s only access point to Shibuya, and then NHK\\'s location at the top of Yoyogi hill gives it not just a view of Mount Fuji but bragging rights to its central place in J-media. Fuji Television, Asahi TV, these are good competitors, but perhaps only Japan has a BBC equivalent as one of its three major stations, to be torn only by the controversy that its president recently denied wartime atrocities. I actually wonder what the foreign staff think-- grandpa was slain on the Bridge to the River Kwai, but my company\\'s CEO has declared there was no war whatsoever. hmmm. but in one bone to toss to the J-right, I can absolutely declare with absolute certainty that there is no secret Japanese doomsday device located in G-CANS or Mount Fuji. I know dozens of people who would have to be involved were there such a thing; there are, as all fanatics are, completely sane in behaviour and speech. \\n whoa \\n instead of exploring this little chain of thought, I will explore the question of how creating \"artificial break points\" is useful for a healthy progression and relationship with time. if I absolutely declare to myself that I will cut off a relationship with a girl if she does not answer my telephone message within 2 weeks, then even if I crushingly submit to her lack of response and way my behind obediently after the two weeks, at least a mental roadblock has been set up in my decline, right. I think that is part of the way towards making time, the immortal force, at least not totally an enemy. however, I am speaking from the last of \"young adulthood,\" and can\\'t necessarily make broad judgments about life, even if I am your father. I mean, these things aren\\'t always related. \\n instead, my immediate might be to riff a little on why the supposed femininity of French culture versus the supposed masculinity of English/Germanic culture makes the English male / French female relationship ever so more harmonious than the reverse. what is going on is a matching of cultural inclinations, yes? but conversely, the culturally English females who make up 36% of my goodreads friends list will naturally feel averse to hearing in precise detail why the French female is inherently more female than them, well, we are treading some very choppy waters here. \\n [image error] \\n I am very displeased to hear that you believe English females are less feminine than their French counterparts. Expelliarmus! \\n impressions are easy! mimicry is fun! Hermione Granger was not supposed to be too cute, Hollywood lies! \\n in the interests of a general explanation of why I adopt English spellings from time to time, I guess it should also be pointed out that expat life is full of more English and Australians and Commonwealthers in general. yes, the expat bubble, in which we finally understand what we are. but, America, being a continent of some 300 million, does not necessarily need all the international understanding that storm-drenched islands in the north sea require. if England failed to understand the Continent, it would have been overwhelmed. England = Japan in that sense, but also not in another. \\n in any case, we have far exceeded the 10000 character jump point and are not making up the deficit created the last time when a J girl interrupted me, I mean a French girl. I was working for Park Hyatt Shinjuku I mean Kensington Park. I am revealing trade secrets or nothing at all. they tried to send me another letter. fail. it might cause massive offensive if I speculate as to whether Chinese or Japanese girls are more feminine, as this is an examination of whether China or Japan is more feminine. hmmm... I am spinning word balloons aren\\'t I. I am organising marriages. \\n time to say good night, GR. if the point hasn\\'t been repeated enough, I am a four-year trained Bachelor of Fine Arts, and I can word smith 10000 characters a day for two or three years. however, not every country in the world permits access to the Goodreads website. if one of these countries employs me, then this period will also come to an end. so specify the topics you desire, time may not be unlimited, This is the sixth HP book, and though it\\'s not quite as dark or long as its predecessor, it does offer greater insight into the life and mind of the man who would come to be known as Voldemort. This is also the book where Harry finally enjoys a real relationship, where we are re-introduced to Fleur, where the Lupin/Tonks pairing is first introduced (it\\'s still one of my favorites) and which has an incredibly sad ending which you probably already know about but which I\\'ll be nice and not spoil for anyone who\\'s been living under a rock in Antarctica for the past decade and hasn\\'t read this book. Very worth reading again, especially since the movie\\'s coming out this summer and you might want to refresh your memory., Oh my god, oh my god, OH MY FREAKING GOD! \\n Did this just happen? DID. THIS. JUST. HAPPEN? \\n Well if you wanna know about how good the book was and all that: it was fan-freaking-tastic. \\n But get prepared for the shock of your literary life at the end., I\\'m giving this one four stars because it\\'s the first Harry Potter book following Prisoner of Azkaban that I didn\\'t feel was dragging its feet to get to the ending. It\\'s definitely tighter than the previous installment, and the story hits its character beats decently well., Love Harry Potter and all of the books in this series., I didn\\'t get into until maybe about 275 pages in but I did get into it. The rest of it was great. The ending nearly made me cry but it was fabtastic. I really cannot wait to go pick up the last book becuase I\\'m anxious to see how it ends., This is in my top 3 favorite Harry Potter books, along with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone. \\n Everything really starts to come together in this book, and the ending just took my breath away! \\n I am anxiously awaiting this movie (this fall!)...the trailer I\\'ve seen looks awesome!, Love rereading this! I forgot so much of the details of stuff that they talk about with horcruxes and of course also all the fun little stuff that I love in the books, DON\\'T TOUCH ME, Listened to it Audio and it was truly a magical experience!, I liked this book a lot. It is mysterious, yet sad, and a bit romantic. Anyone who likes any of those catigories will LOVE this book., - \\n I\\'m obsessed! I gone through So many emotions while reading this, I don\\'t think it\\'s possible for someone to review Harry Potter. \\n Who else cried when Dumbledore died :\\'( ! \\n And oh poor Harry :,( ! \\n I love it love it !! This is my escape., God, I loved this book. It was incredible and it\\'s got some really big story points that really contribute to the whole. \\n I think the only reason why I\\'m not giving this one the whole five stars is the fact that the book seems to be set up for the last book. It\\'s almost like JK Rowling wrote this book so that she can tell people \"oh, this is happening right now because I dropped that hint in the last book it was going to happen.\" \\n It\\'s a book of conveniences. Even the major event was a convenience that will be happening soon. \\n I did cry, though. I didn\\'t think that was going to happen. Wow. I have emotions. Isn\\'t that something?, The ending to the book caused me to have a lot of mixed emotions., I thought this was the best out of the series. couldnt put it down., I\\'m sure that many of you have already read this book. It\\'s not as good, or as fast paced as the 4th and 5th books, but I still enjoyed it a lot. I had re-read the earlier books and then read this, all in a row, so I got the full Harry Potter experience. I just can\\'t believe the ending. Seriously, I\\'m still deciding on whether to believe it, or if it\\'s a trick..., ?Como le hace J.K. Rowling para que cada libro este mejor? Generalmente en todas las sagas, llega un punto en que van en decaida, pero en este caso... cada vez se ponen mejor. En cada libro siempre pienso \"este es el mejor\". \\n Me gusta que cada vez tenemos mas respuestas, y que toda la trama del libro esta bien planeada y entrelazada. Que bien que ya conocemos mas del pasado de Voldemort, por que honestamente lo poco que sabiamos del libro de la Camara de los Secretos no me dejaban las cosas muy claras. \\n Que triste el final :( creo que se pudo haber ahorrado eso... pero bueno, ya que. \\n Y que bueno que el Harry mando a la fregada a la llorona de la Cho., Still loving it., woooooooooooooow!!! better than the movie .you have to read it ^_^!!^_^, So this one wasn\\'t my favorite. Harry\\'s obsession with Malfoy drove me a bit crazy and I wanted to hit him by the mid way point in the book. But that ending ripped my heart out and saved the entire book in my opinion. One more to go. 3.5 [?], I CAN\\'T BELIEVE THIS BOOK I am crying I do not want this series to end ever. My favorite part of this book (and pretty much all of the other books) are just the characters; they are all so gently and carefully crafted and I love them SO MUCH. Such a great read <3 <3 <3, fav, After Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix kicked off the fight between the Order of the Phoenix and Voldemort\\'s Death Eaters, I couldn\\'t wait to read the continuation. This book successfully builds on the previous Harry Potter books, and fits into the series as the link between the first five books and the last one. \\n J.K. Rowling again includes creatures and magic drawn from ancient cultures and magical legends, and the dialog and drama elevate the book well beyond the level of a traditional children\\'s book., I\\'m so happy to re-read this book. It reminds me why is my favourite <3., For me, this book wasn\\'t even in the same league as the past 5. It was just on a new level all it\\'s own. I was blown away. \\n I loved it and picked up the next one immediately. \\n So, so good., I love everything about the Harry Potter series, no one will ever change my mind., It was one of my favorites but Also like #7 kind of long and boring. but still a great book. I can\\'t wait for the movie!!!, ***SPOILER ALERT*** \\n This book was really amazing it even made me cry. Even if I know a lot of spoilers which my friend have told me about Snape being the Half Blood Prince, Snape killed Dumbledore, Ginny and Harry being together, about the horcrux was a fake, my friend actually told me the summary of this book. \\n I think even if I know a lot of what was going to happen I still find it painful to read it especially the part when Dumbledore was killed and Hagrid was talking to Harry and Hagrid doesn\\'t know at that moment that Dumbledore was already dead. It was really painful for me and i cried at that point because it was like suddenly the most person that you think the greatest of them all and actually the one wizard that Voldemort feared was dead. To think that Snape killed him and that the horcrux was fake i feel really terrible that it all ended that way. \\n I think that this ending was more depressing than when Sirius Black was killed on the Order of the Phoenix. There were so many questions that really need answers. That would make you after reading this book think, be nervous about what would possibly happen. \\n I really felt that this was a good book and hope that the movie would not disappoint me. I saw a trailer of it wherein the burrow was burned it\\'s not in the book though. I can\\'t wait to buy \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows.\" Really Harry Potter series made me hooked that i truly recommended everyone to read this book., I have a confession to make...I\\'ve not read the last 2 books in the Harry Potter series. Until now! I was very excited to get into this audio book. I knew nothing about it. I purposefully didn\\'t see the film so I wouldn\\'t ruin the book when I finally did read it. I went in blind. \\n This book is so full of adventure!I\\'m practically obsessed with this world. To be fair, I think most people are. It is so creative and eevrything about it intrigues me. \\n The narration is very good. I think Stephen Fry is getting better. I\\'m really feeling the different character voices he\\'s created. It truly is an enjoyable audio book. I\\'m listening while I do my chores and it helps me take my mind off the mundane. Totally worth it to me. \\n You need to add Harry Potter to your list of audio book must haves. I\\'m blown away! One more book! How will it all end?! I don\\'t know, I\\'ve not read it or seen the film so don\\'t tell me anything!, I had the unabridged audiobook version of this, which was narrated by Stephen Fry. I listened to it whilst on holiday in Mallorca. \\n I thought it started in a in unusual way. In the first two chapters there was hardly any trace of central characters, aside from Professor Snape. The first chapter was devoted to interactions between Cornelius Fudge and the Muggle Prime Minister. In some ways, that part of the book felt more like a spin-off short story (something I think JK Rowling could do a lot more of). \\n Then it got back to normal, but it is darker than the previous books. A lot of time is also spent with the interactions between Dumbledore and Harry Potter. \\n Towards the end, the was a lot of emotion and drama. It felt less like a magical children\\'s story. At this stage, you can see that the series is growing up with the audience. \\n I have heard some criticism of the film version. I can understand why. Obviously, there are differences to the book. It\\'s also less in line with what there\\'s been before. \\n However, I thought both were great and the book is even better. It serves as a necessary set up to the events of the Deathly Hallows. \\n You cannot skip this book. There is too much content and too much explanation to miss out on. The emotion and drama is crucial to understanding the mentality and actions of many characters., Much better than the last few books, less angst, phew!, I never wanted it to end, ** spoiler alert ** \\n Admittedly rereading the death of Dumbledore while pregnant may not have been the smartest thing I\\'ve done, but I find that this entire series holds up as an adult as it does as a child. Jo Rowling has an innate understanding of the human (and child) psyche, making every character as real and as three-dimensional as your real friends and family. \\n Edit: I ugly cry every time I read about Dumbledore\\'s death and funeral., June 25th, 2016 - July 5th, 2016 (4.5 stars) \\n Rereading before The Cursed Child comes out. \\n Really enjoyed reading this, I was reminded of the first time I read it. \\n It\\'s kind of frustrating reading it now because I know Draco is going to bring Death Eaters into the castle and Dumbledore will die but I don\\'t ever want it to happen! \\n October 5th, 2014 - October 11th, 2014 (5 stars) \\n A lot fancier than the UK version, I especially like the little touches like the different fonts and Hagrid\\'s tear-stained letter. \\n The pictures were nice though the book is a lot bigger as a result, so not quite so portable - I kept my UK edition in my bag for reading when out and about, and kept the US edition by the bed for reading at home. \\n Had good fun spotting all the differences between the UK edition and this one, things like whiskey, Sorceror\\'s Stone and pants. \\n Would like to get the US editions of the rest of the series., I was rather surprised about who she killed off. I am not very good at seeing things like that. I never know whodunnit., I love how politics are portrayed so realistically. The wizarding government uses people and symbols to advance an agenda. In Hogwarts, Slughorn uses people to advance his sense of his own importance. At Harry\\'s age is when this difficult reality becomes apparent--the grown up world--is laden with smallness and fear., I LOVED all of these books. What I loved most? That SO many people turned their reading skills back on and that so many kids started. I\\'m fairly certain that these books alone brought back reading worldwide with a vengeance. Just amazing., As the release of the seventh book nears, I thought it would be prudent to refresh my memory of the Potter mythos. So I reread Book 6. As I remembered, it was one of the high points of the series--made all the more excellent by the fact that it followed the lackluster fifth book. \\n Harry has overcome most of the childish petulance that both marked and marred his character in Book 5 and Rowling returns to (and further perfects) the formula for adventure that has made the series so popular with readers the world over. \\n As every one of the books feature some authorial missteps, so does the penultimate installment. Still, nothing quite so off-putting as Hermione\\'s house elf activism. The romantic torment and jealousy (the most ill-wrought portion of Book 6) is mild and does not drag out like Harry\\'s attitude did in Book 5 (and in truth, it seemed much longer the first time I read). As well, the chapter leading up to the climax was weakly conceived and was the only point at which I felt the book dragged (both in my first reading and in this re-read). \\n In any case, a well-done book and one that whets well the appetite for the conclusion. \\n p.s. it also had a ton of typos--which seemed strange to me., All in all: AVERAGE. \\n 1. I noticed in this book that there were so many elements that shows no significance at all. Like, the first chapter, it was not that good as an introduction. Dobby and Kreachers\\'s scene also. \\n 2. Matters in this book were getting more serious. Although, I like Ron&Hermione\\'s loveteam as well as Harry&Ginny\\'s. But, I was disappointed because I expected that Ginny will stick to him until the end. Let me see at the last book. ;) \\n 4. I love Malfoy\\'s character here! It was like, he stepped out from his usual routine of boasting and bullying. Likewise, he became more matured in this book for taking up responsibility for the loss of his dad\\'s character. This book unleashed the evil in him. T\\'was a great start of him. \\n 5. I also like the Pensieve more here. It was a great part of the puzzle. The memory from Slughorn, the Felix Felicis, Aragog\\'s burial, all served its purpose. The sequence was well made and it was indeed a good plot. \\n 6. I like the part of the Horcruxes. I like how parts from other books became part of this mystery. Lucius Malfoys\\' scene with the Riddle\\'s Diary! The secret of the Horcruxes makes me want to read and finish the last book as soon as possible! It became the highlight of the mystery, of what was the rest of it, where was it, how does Harry Potter suppose to break it, and so on and so forth. I believe that it was a great element of fiction. Brilliant! \\n 7. Snape as the half-blood prince was definitely bland. I thought that it was a huge character in the near future. The book from him was a bit exciting at first, then, it was just revealed at the end like that?! The book was entitled to it! That\\'s how the story must evolve! Seriously, that\\'s my point of view. :D \\n 8. DUMBLEDORE\\'S DEAD. I CAN\\'T BELIEVE IT! Makes me sad and kinda teary-eyed. Never expect that he\\'s going to die! Just like that? Uh. He died effortless. I cannot absorb that fact! Maybe if he died during a fight, something like that, it was more easier to accept. :\\'(, I remember being surprised to learn that Harry would not be attending Hogwarts for his final year of school, but upon rereading, it\\'s clear that by Book Six, Hogwarts has become little more than a place for Harry to bump into the other characters. The various romantic subplots are perhaps the strongest reminder of the youth of the main characters, and while there are a few Quidditch matches thrown into the mix and occasional offhand references to classes, homework, and studying, it would be relatively easy to transfer the story to another setting altogether. Rowling has almost completely abandoned her formula, but surprisingly, it seems to work. \\n Still, I was disappointed to find that Snape\\'s promotion to teaching Defense against the Dark Arts was only a plot point in so much as it made it possible for Harry to continue potions classes. Harry\\'s conflict with Snape (and, by proxy, his conflict with the legacy of his father), much more so than his conflicts with Draco or Voldemort, has become the most interesting motive force of the plot, and I found myself waiting for Rowling to take advantage of Snape\\'s intrusion into Harry\\'s territory. \\n As for the rest of the book, I found Dumbledore\\'s lessons to be unnecessarily drawn out; Slughorn\\'s memory seemed somewhat less than crucial, since Dumbledore most certainly already knew what a Horcrux was and why Voldemort might want one. At least, however, Rowling relied much less on prolonging the plot by having one character unnecessarily withhold information that would easily resolve everything., This is not my favorite book in the Harry Potter series. (I would be hard pressed to tell you which one is, but I know it\\'s not this one.) Regardless, it\\'s still a wonderful book. We continue on with Harry\\'s tale, fighting evil along the way. \\n As the series goes on the books become a little darker and Harry a little moodier. Some readers may not enjoy this. However, it doesn\\'t bother me much, because it seems true to Harry\\'s character and the things he\\'s going through in his life. Harry\\'s friends, teacher\\'s and classmates are as true to their characters as ever. It\\'s quite a treat to immerse myself into this magical world. There are some romances introduced in this story as well. Nothing gets graphic or anything, but it\\'s a reminder that the characters are growing up and not far from becoming adults. \\n This book has left me quite emotional. There are some BIG events that make readers aware that the end of the story is getting closer all the time. If you\\'re reading this review and haven\\'t tried the Harry Potter series - stop, go get books 1-7, and get started reading!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n one of the best but one of the saddest. Dumbledore was my fave! i cried my heart out it was so sad!! I loved it!, Dumbledore\\'s death always gets me right in the feels. Not only is he the wisest, most caring, and patient wizard ever, and Harry\\'s latest father-figure (so obvi doomed to death), he is also the last crutch of childhood Harry has left, the last bit of dependence Harry still has. With Dumbledore\\'s death, Harry has to become an independent adult. Fighting the bad guys is no longer a rush of excitement but a responsibility. And Snape is sooo evil, it\\'s so hard to see any possibility of redemption, even knowing his full story. Still, this time, it felt like reading the book for the first time all over again., This one lays the groundwork for the finale., 4.6, My second favorite., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I read the first chapters and I knew then that I would like this book. At the end if it I was looking at my new favorite book. I love J.K. Rowling\\'s writing and the characters in the book. There is alot going on and we get so much information which makes this a really good book. \\n As I said, the book began well and when I read pages after pages I started to enjoy reading it. I\\'m really excited to read the end, but I don\\'t want it to end... Sigh, but we all must read the end some time... \\n Back to the book; \\n I liked the new teacher Slughorn! He was a really interesting person and the potion lessons was fun to read. \\n I was also surprised to read who the half blood prince were!; Snape. I thought Voldemort were the half blood prince, but nevermind. \\n It was sad to read about Dumbledore\\'s death, like the previous book; Sirius. \\n This book is definitly a five stars!! \\n Read this now!!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n This is probably my favorite HP book so far. I love learning about the back stories of Voldemort and why he became who he is. Also Ginny and Harry, enough said., why did you do this to me?!, I feel like I need to go back through my reviews of books I\\'ve read in the past and lower my ratings. Only a handful can compare to this series. This book is so beautiful and tragic at the same time. A book has never made me cry as much as this one has. 10 million stars! I can\\'t believe I only have one left! *so emotional*, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I can\\'t believe they killed Dumbledore., The sixth book in the HP series.....the makings of the end are starting to come together.....I cried more in this book than in the first five combined. If you haven\\'t read it, go do it!!, I\\'m happy that the Harry Potter series was something I saved for being an adult, because I cried a lot at the end. Teenage or child me wouldnt have been able to handle the pain from this series. I was a complete mess, just sitting there having a hard time believing that a book could make me so emotional. Good job JK. This story is mint. Highly recommended., Well, I didn\\'t sob nearly as hard on this reading as I did the first time I read it, although there were still some tears shed. I\\'m just now more than ready to read the final volume., Love it. This one is sad but I loved it., Ugh, this series is so beautifully plotted! You can feel everything start to come together in this book, setting up the final one nicely., Annual reread. I love JK, but romance is not her strong point., I think I enjoyed this book most of them all. Rowling\\'s sense of humor never lets the reader down, and her touch with teen emotions is so deft. The old plot veers slightly as Voldemort himself fails to appear--but we learn all about his past as, at last, Dumbledore talks to Harry and answers Questions. \\n There is a surprise at the end that was no surprise to this adult reader, but it certainly was to the kids I taught. It was interesting to see how Rowling set it up, cushioning it, in effect, so the kid reader would see it as inevitable. \\n It was also interesting to see how she set upSnape as a shadow prince to Harry\\'s Prince. It was obvious to me where this was going to go, but it was interesting watching kids try to guess. Harry\\'s \\'shadow\\' and he are seemingly adversaries, meanwhile the Voldemort threat is kept alive. \\n There are a lot of good world building touches in this book. Though magic still doesn\\'t quite seem to do anything whatever besides provide means for magic wars, the otherworldly touches are fascinating--the phoenix, the centaurs, the mer folk, and of course the various monsters. Characterwise, there are some satisfying pair-ups. \\n Again, I was glad to see far less emphasis on good blood and social status. Fleur, who was so tiresome in the past, gets off one of the best lines in the book., The most intense HP book yet! I love how Harry\\'s become a strong, dark, brave man, yet not an anti-hero., I\\'m pretty sure everyone know that DUMBLEDORE DIES. so no spoiler alert. \\n But what surprised me about the death was not the death ITSELF but the fact that I didn\\'t feel anything. I didn\\'t really care. I sort of read the passage emotionless. The spell and everything. I didn\\'t hate Snape. or Malfoy. or feel what all of the other Hogwarts teachers felt. \\n Not that I felt happy. I just didn\\'t feel anything. \\n And that\\'s when it hit me. \\n J K Rowling\\'s attempt to create a wise and caring mentor for Harry failed. Dumbledore was anything BUT a good mentor. \\n How could he hire Lockhart, Quirrel, fake Moody, and Umrbridge when he had the student\\'s BEST interests at heart? Isn\\'t he supposed to be skilled in Legilimens? Shouldn\\'t he have fought the Ministry\\'s attempt to interfere at Hogwarts? \\n And shouldn\\'t he have prepared Harry better? He doesn\\'t tell Harry ANYTHING about defeating Hogwarts... at the end of every book, he give some lame speech about Harry\\'s bravery and about how LOVE saved him. Only in the sixth book does he attempt to show Harry anything about Voldemort\\'s death... and then he dies. Because he put on the ring because he was tempted by the power or something. He selfishly kills himself when Harry needs him most. When he could have kept Hogwarts safe from Voldemort.. and could have kept Dumbledore\\'s Army safe from the Carrows\\' beatings. \\n So Dumbledore dies. And Harry\\'s left alone to fight Voldemort.. with barely any lead.. or anything to go for. \\n And that\\'s all due to Dumbledore., I\\'m a sobbing mess. This re-read hurt. This hurt so much., Rowling sustains the series well. I was as eager to read the next as I had enjoyed the last one., Is Harry Potter truly the Chosen One? Potter is 16 now, entering his 6th year at Hogwarts, and just a year shy of \"adulthood\" in the wizard world. He\\'s still shaken by the loss he suffered at the end of book 5, but he\\'s been safe at the Dursley\\'s over the holiday break. Still the Dark Lord\\'s forces are gathering strength and there is considerable danger about. This book gives the reader a bit more insight into the life of the boy who became Voldemort. Rowling uses this look at the past to teach an important lesson about how our choices define who we are and what we become. Friendship and loyalty remain a central theme. It\\'s a fast and enjoyable read, and highly recommended for Potter fans. \\n Audio book performed by Jim Dale. \\n Jim Dale\\'s performance of this book is wonderful. His pacing and his facility for different voices lend drama and excitement. His sonorous tones give life to Snape, Dumbledore, Hagrid and Voldemort; and he is still able to give us a hint of youth for Harry and the other young wizards (though he\\'s really not very good at the young women - Hermione, Ginny, Lavender, et al)., Spectacular! \\n This has such a great turning point in the end. This whole series really takes you out of this world. You feel like you truly do belong at Hogwarts. This is second place of my top three HP books. This makes you questions Snape and where he put his loyalty. It makes you tear up in the end but it is all so well thought out., This the most most most favorite book of mine from the series. Why? I don\\'t know the exact reason. But I love it! \\n Although the ending always leaves me in tears, I love this book! When Fawkes, the Phoenix flies away and sings at the end, I always find myself sobbing! \\n This book has everything that a Harry Potter book should have. There is fun, gloominess, dark magic, love, everything. Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione...everything falls into places! You get to know Voldemorts early childhood, his darkest secrets which lead Dumbledore and Harry to the right path of destroying him \\n Oh how much I wish I could be a guest of Slughorns parties! I would have taken Fred or George with me! ^_^ \\n Here, for the first time I felt pity for Draco! -_- \\n And this book highlighted Ron a lot and I liked that. I hated him for making Hermione sad though! \\n And the potions book of halfblood prince!! It caused Harry so much trouble, but it was undoubtedly the crown jewel of this book. I fell for halfblood prince and it surprised me a lot when the true identity of the halfblood prince was revealed. \\n I still remember I was crying like a baby when I read the last few pages! My mom came up wondering what might have happened! This book started to make me cry and it continued up to The Deathly Hallows! I have cried a lot and cursed Snape for a long time! \\n God! I love this book and the movie sooooo much! :\\'), Where to even begin? \\n I remember when the movie had came out, before I had even started reading the series. See I thought it was just another one of those series that people obsess over and make all these dumb fan clubs. (Which is true but I am now a Potter geek myself.) \\n Anyway...people at school were saying how Dumbledore dies and how he is a great wizard and all that. I forgot what they had said by the time I started reading. It wasn\\'t till I started reading this book when I realizes Dumbledore was the great wizard that was going to die. \\n I hoped it wasn\\'t going to be this book, but I was wrong. \\n I enjoyed Draco growing as a character and not being so....arrogant. Seeing him from going from being so high to having troubles, made him so much more real. \\n Since Dumbledore was teaching Harry about Voldemort\\'s past, I was sure the half-blood prince was him. He was a half -blood as we learned and an heir. Since he always wanted to be special, he called himself a prince. To my great surprise, it was Snape. Then he shocked me even more by killing Snape. \\n Ron and Hermione irritated me to no end. It is clear that they both like each other and I\\'m pretty sure Harry can see that. But why doesn\\'t he help them?? I usually can stand their bickering, but like the entire book, they are ignoring each other. \\n It made my day when Harry got with Ginny. They have some really great chemistry and I hope that doesn\\'t get lost on screen. I understand why he ended it in the end, but I wish he never did that. \\n Good book., My favourite book of the serie so far. It was emotionally intense and genuinely PHENOMENAL. And I really burst into tears at the last two chapters... Can\\'t wait to start HP and the deathly hallows..., The Harry Potter series is definitely a series everyone should read, so if you haven\\'t, go get them! It\\'s a fun and magical read about family, friends, freedom, and a continuous battle between good and evil. \\n J.K. Rowling did a fantastic job with this series! Really bringing it to life and sending a good message to young readers, and even adults. The writing is good, not too detailed though because it is a children\\'s series (though enjoyable for all-ages). The plot throughout the series is well thought out. There are some parts in each book where it gets a little long and dull, but if you push through it it\\'ll go back to being exciting. \\n I thought that the fifth book (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix) was dragged out to the point that is was dull, but all the other books will keep you sucked in until the last page. My favorites out of the series are Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. There are a few swear words throughout the series but nothing too bad and not that many, they show up very rarely (mostly in the beginning books of the series). \\n You really connect with all of the characters, and there are so many that you can relate with one if not more. The creatures in this series are also really cool, dragons, centaurs, mermaids, giants, and more. This series really lets your imagination go wild. \\n http://www.infinitybookreview.blogspo..., (Note - I own 2 copies of this book - hb and pb), ** spoiler alert ** \\n I really liked it. I love that Ginny and Harry finally got toghter., Another rating: 10/10, Many pages, but definitely not dull to read. What will happen, what will happen?, just the amazing books like other! \\n many adventures and sad oarts in this book. :(, Excellent read, as usual., A wonderful reread. By the end of this book, things have been set up nicely for Harry to finish his quest and face Voldemort once and for all. \\n I read this one for the Animal category in Scattegories. Category - Animal. Letter - A. Animal in the book - Aragog, king of arachnids (p483 Hardcover) \\n Reread February 2016., Probably one of my favorites in the series so far. I absolutely love this series!, I have to say that I didn\\'t like this book as much as I liked the ones before it, although I still enjoyed reading it. And it was more like the movie than I would have thought. I think my favorite part of this book was the further characterization of the main characters, especially the teenage romances. The story itself didn\\'t really capture me that much this time. \\n This book opens with use getting a glimpse of the \"dark side\" - Narcissa Malfoy approaches Snape and compels him to swear an Unbreakable Vow that he will protect Draco no matter what happens. Bellatrix Lestrange accompanies Narcissa, and fights with Snape over the fact that she doesn\\'t believe he is truly on their side, while Snape explains himself. This sets up the idea that Snape still cannot be trusted, as Harry has always believed. And we know that Draco is up to something - he seems to have been given a task by the Dark Lord himself, however unlikely that seems to everyone but Harry. Harry becomes increasingly obsessed with Draco, and whatever he is up to, sometimes forsaking friends and responsibilities in order to solve the puzzle. This book also brings the addition of Professor Slughorn, an old Potions teacher that Dumbledore seems to have brought back to Hogwarts in order to get valuable information from him. And of course there is more teenage heartache and infatuation, as the main characters are only sixteen, after all. \\n I am determined to believe that Snape is on the side of good, no matter how bad he seems to be. (No spoilers please, I haven\\'t read the seventh book or seen any of the movie, and I\\'ve managed to avoid all mention of it so far!!!) My main reason for believing this is that Alan Rickman always has facial hair when he\\'s playing a bad guy - he\\'s clean-shaven when he\\'s good. Also, Dumbledore trusted him, right? So we\\'ll see how the seventh book finishes it all up!, This in the series is much shorter than I remembered!, Sedikit kesel sama diri sendiri karena ngotot mau baca ulang buku keenam ini. \\n Emosi terkuras abis saat baca buku ini dan skarang jadi berasa adaptasi filmnya gak ada apa-apanya. \\n Gak berhasil bikin nyesek sehebat pas baca bukunya. \\n Hmmm...*masih mewek, ** spoiler alert ** \\n This is the first book in the series where it felt like a bridge to the next one. The exposition about horcruxes felt rushed. I didn\\'t ever really believe Snape was on one side or the other, and when he killed Dumbledore it felt like something that didn\\'t actually happen. It\\'s a good chapter in a great story, but for the first time the book seemed like it was relying on the larger story, rather than the other way around., I am so sad....so sad., A little slow moving in the beginning, and certainly depressing, but who can argue with Rowling\\'s incredible plot weavings?, My favorite HP book. I don\\'t remember how many times I\\'ve read it. I love it so much., I\\'m just going to pretend that that ending never happened. Nope. \\n Words cannot describe how beautiful this book was and how it was such a great pleasure to read. It all links back to the first few books which was excellent, and uncovers many truths about Voldemort and Harry Potter. A very gripping tale and absolutely magical. \\n I can\\'t really write a good review as I\\'m surrounded by a puddle of my tears, my apologies., I just love all of these books., Amazing, as always :), humm. \\n cover yang paling saya suka. \\n hehe. \\n ga sabar nunggu filmnya juga. hehe., audiobook \\n by this point, you can see Rowling weaving a complex tale to the finale. This book is a fine tapestry of seemingly unrelated things and emotional character. \\n If you are not in love with each main character by now, you might be heartless. I knew what was coming and what is to come - and each reveal pulls on heart strings you didn\\'t even know were there. \\n Teenage angst is abound too! \\n love book six as much as any other... and now to wait a bit before the emotional roller coaster that is book seven., Too busy starting the last book to review much. A little bittersweet to start this last book of the series. Not sure if there is life after Harry..., Doesn\\'t matter ho many times I read this book I still get hooked on the story. I still feel emotional when the battle at Hogwarts occurs and still feel sad that such a great character dies at the end., I\\'m going to read this Baby again before the movie comes out so I can remember what it is about., See my review of Deathly Hallows, 3.5 heartbreaking stars \\n Rowling connects every single detail efficiently..I can\\'t quite nail the pattern of Rowling\\'s writing.. Surprises in every single book.. \\n \"Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle\\'s reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, \\'Tom\\'?\" \\n First two books were relaxed, in the third, the story \\n was heating up, voldemort rose in fourth, Harry\\'s true first fight in fifth, preparation for second battle in sixth..(like being familiar with voldemort ..knowing his weak points...) And the final and second battle in seventh..(as in revelations in Bible, the second coming or the final battle..) Rowling has planned it well.. Though I understand it limitedly.. \\n A few thoughts: \\n \"In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination.\" \\n Oblivious reasons are sometimes scarier then obvious ones.. \\n \"That\\'s not unicorn hair, Hagrid?\" \\n \"Oh, yeah,\" said Hagrid indifferently. \"Gets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches an\\' stuff in the forest, yeh know ...\" \\n \"But my dear chap, do you know how much that\\'s worth?\" \\n \"I use it fer bindin\\' on bandages an stuff if a creature gets in jured,\" said Hagrid, shrugging. \"It\\'s dead useful. . . very strong.\" \\n Happened after Aragog\\'s burial.. This is why I love hagrid\\'s character.. Been laughing all the way through Aragog\\'s burial!! \\n sang Slughorn plaintively. \\n \"They laid him to rest with his hat inside out. \\n And his wand snapped in two, which was sad.\" \\n \". . . terrible,\" Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply. \\n This is my favorite portion in this book..DSO FUNNY!!! \\n \"You\\'d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,\" said Harry. \"It would be a very brave and noble thing to do.\" \\n Some things happen and you just have to wait and take it slow to undo the misshapen or strengthen the good. \\n am afraid,\\' she went on, \\'that the nag - I\\'m sorry, the centaur - knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him - one Seer to another - had he not, too, sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!\\' \\n I wish there was professor trelawny and firenzes conversation in the book..I loved those very much! \\n \"Your blood is worth more than mine.\" \\n How humble of Dumbledore.. Wish I could be as humble and caring as dumbledore. Selfless,all the way.. \\n \\'Yeah, that fits,\\' said Harry. \\'He\\'d play up the pureblood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them ... he\\'s just like Voldemort. Pureblood mother, Muggie father ... ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name - Lard Voldemort - the HalfBlood Prince - how could Dumbledore have missed -?\\' \\n The most vital portion which led to the heading of the book., Fabulous as always., Fourth Time: \\n Started: 8/19/2016 \\n Finished: 8/22/2016, Loved it!! So ready to read #7 after reading this., Read my full thoughts on the whole series over at Read.Write.Repeat. \\n As Rowling sets up for the big finale, Harry finally starts to mature and Dumbledore finally starts to trust him. In case you had any doubts about the good vs. evil, light vs. dark battle building in the series, Rowling fully embraces Harry\\'s internal and external conflicts in this penultimate novel., I\\'ve read all the Harry Potter books more times than I could say. My favorites are the last three., I wasn\\'t really very happy with this book, but upon speaking with some friends, I decided that it was a really important book in the series and that I\\'m really wanting MORE of it... it makes me happy that I am so far behind the rest of the world and don\\'t have to wait if I don\\'t want to!, I went from the 5th book to this and I was like, \" It\\'s so short!\" The beginning was boring but it gets good around chapter 11ish and beyond., Primera lectura: 2007 \\n Segunda lectura: 2017 \\n Wow, no se por donde empezar. Este y el el ultimo libro de la saga fueron los que menos relei en mi vida. Y me alegro de volver a leerlo. \\n As se muestra un Harry que duda de Dumbledore, que hace frente cuando lo siente necesario, que defiende sus ideas. Se nota que crecio y que pasa por la adolescencia, entre tanta desgracia que le pasa. \\n Me gusto mucho mas que el anterior libro., I think this is my favorite of the series. I love some of the events in here and hate others. But I adore Potter and Dumbledore., certainly continues with the more adult themes the books have turned to. Harry is a bit more mature but still a boy in search of love and happiness. Tension builds nicely and the elements of the whole magic world Rowlings has build are moving toward the climax. As I\\'ve read these over, I am finding important little things I missed in the first flush of reading., Even though book number 3 is my favorite this book is the best book so far. \\n I read this book after moving into a big empty house, we had all our furniture in one room. And I was sleeping on a couch in that room with the heap of all our worldly possessions. The situation would have been depressing except that I would come home from work and read this book. And that made the experience one of my fondest moving experiences. \\n After finishing this book I was converted into one of those dorks who was going to get the Harry Potter book the day that it came out., I love the Harry Potter series. Really, I do. But I have to say that I hate... no, I despise... the character of Harry Potter. When I was younger and initially reading the series, I wrote off his whinny behavior. I didn\\'t like him then, and he was never close to my favorite character, but I was able to tolerate him. Now I am utterly repulsed by him. I hate how he always thinks that he is right and everyone else is wrong. I hate how he gets stuck on one idea and no matter what Dumbledore or anyone else says, he thinks that he is obviously right and they are wrong. But most of all, I hate how rude and disrespectful he is to Snape. I don\\'t care how much you hate a person, Snape is not all your elder, but he is your teacher and therefore you are to show him respect. I have had my fair share of teachers I have hated, one I even got fired, but I always treated them with the respect that was due to a person with their authority. But Harry Potter can not get past his hate for Snape and so he is deliberately rude to his face, and that is inexcusable to me. \\n I also got annoyed with how Harry blamed Snape for Sirius going off and getting himself killed. Sirius was a grown man and shouldn\\'t have let himself get goaded. Not only that but Sirius was practically asking for it. He is the one who insisted that he had to be a part of the action. He is the one who rushed out and would not be left behind and he was the one who wanted to get out of the house so badly, no thought to his life or any such thing. I think that because Sirius was sent to Azkaban when he was young, he never really grew up. He was stuck as a 20-something year old man that just wanted to have fun and never had to think of anyone else besides himself. Sure, I feel bad for him getting locked up when he was innocent, but I do think that he acted immaturely and he also goaded Snape as well. \\n But despite all of that, I love the world that J.K. Rowling has created. The magical world that she thought up that drew in so many fans to the point that they go crazy about one aspect or another is amazing and shows how truly talented she is. There have been so many times in my life I wished that I could escape away to Hogwarts. I wish I had a Dumbledore in my life. I have spent my fair share of time fantasizing about it (and reading fanfiction when I was younger lol). And that is why this series will always be a favorite of mine. I will be passing these on to my children and grandchildren. I feel like it is ageless and timeless. \\n The battle between good and evil is a story that will be told till the end of time, and this is just another story with new characters and different elements in it. This is a story that has such vivid characters and real places and it makes you really want to be a part of this world. It is absolutely wonderful. I wish there were more stories in this series because I never wanted to leave this world. \\n Jim Dale does an amazing job reading this story. His voices are engaging and he is really amazing. When I first started listening to the series, I was unsure about his voices for some of the characters, like Hermione. But the voices changes a bit and weren\\'t quite so annoying and now I absolutely love them. If it wasn\\'t so expensive, I would buy this series for myself on cd. \\n Rating: 4.5/5, Always a good reread., I won\\'t say more than that this is absolutley heart-breaking and genious. \\n ____________ \\n It\\'s fucking breaking my heart. Like literally. It\\'s genious how J.K is writing the plot. You are so confused about Snape and whose side he is actually on. You start to feel so sorry for Harry for having to go through all of this., Is it wrong that I enjoy these books more when they\\'re not almost 900 pages? Sometimes there\\'s too many extras that don\\'t necessarily add to the story line. \\n This is probably the most entertaining for me so far, maybe because a major character was lost and things are beginning to reach that literary climax. Unfortunately, friends of mine gave me spoilers along the way so nothing came as a shock to me, which hindered my bond with this book., Best one Yet., This was a re-read. I enjoyed it just as much as always. Listened to it on audiobook this time around., This was amazing!, Phenomenal! The ending really broke my heart. Can\\'t wait to read the next one!!!, \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do!\" \\n \"It is not our abilities that show what we truly are, it is our choices.\" \\n \"I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you\\'d turn them on me like your filthy father, would you? I don\\'t think so...No!\" \\n \"Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies.\", Me and my brother read it together... And when albus died we cried like aything.. Our parents got concerned hee hee., i wish i could rate it more than just five out of five... \\n i saw this somewhere... \"That moment when you finish a book, look around, and realize that everyone is just carrying on with their lives as though you didn\\'t just experience emotional trauma at the hands of a paperback.\" And this makes so much sense right now..., OK. I\\'m prepared to admit I\\'ve read it. As someone once said about Jeffrey Archer novels, it\\'s rather like a packet of stale chips. You keep taking them out and eating them, hoping that the ones at the bottom are little better. But they\\'re not. After a while, you notice that the bag is empty, and you feel rather disgusted with yourself. \\n She claims the whole story was planned from the beginning. Yeah, right. Though, to be fair, she\\'s in good company; Proust said something similar about A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu. He didn\\'t come across as very credible either. \\n _________________________ \\n If you still don\\'t believe me about the links between Proust and Potter, look here. If that doesn\\'t convince you, I give up. There\\'s such a thing as being too sceptical for your own good., Harry Potter is always a good go to., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Finished 3/10/2016: \\n This is truly one of the best of the series. My boys begged me to finish reading the last two chapters tonight and went to bed more than an hour past their bedtime... \\n Finished 2/17/2010: \\n This is J.K. Rowling back on form. The story had to pick up after the previous installment, but this one answered so many questions and gave us some of the highest highs (Harry as Quidditch captain! Ron & Hermione and Harry & Ginny together!) and lowest lows (Dumbledore\\'s torture and death! Snape\\'s ultimate betrayal!). There was a lot of ground, factually and emotionally for this book to cover as the penultimate one of the series, and it managed to get the job done admirably without prolonging it (like the last book did oh-so-painfully) and without skimping on the humor, Wizarding World insights, or emotional investment. \\n I found the glimpses into Voldemort\\'s past to be fascinating. Piece by piece we learned just how Tom Riddle became the Dark Lord. Some of the other reviews have commented that the whole book was \"telling\" instead of \"showing.\" I completely disagree. That wonderful device, the Pensieve, actually made showing possible. \\n Even in the midst of the fight against Voldemort and the Death Eaters, we still had teenagers growing up, learning who they were and where they fit in the world. I appreciate that Ms. Rowling was true to the characters\\' development, not allowing them to get lost in the overall action story. \\n And that Felix Felicis stuff is fabulous...where can I get me some??? \\n For more book reviews, come visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves., While the Harry Potter series will never be on the \"books I love forever and ever\" list, I must say, I really enjoyed reading the last half of book 5, and book 6 again. The rest of the books were kind of tedious, and I still don\\'t like the begining of five, but I am, at least, excited for the 7th book., Yep, Harry Potter book series, by J. K. Rowling and published by Bloomsbury and Scholastic Inc, 1997-2007 (seven books). \\n As many times as I have mentioned Harry Potter or J. K. Rowling, I have not officially done a review of the book series. So in honor of October, Halloween, and our recent trip to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios, Orlando; here it is. \\n The list of the books, from first to last: \\n Harry Potter and the [Philosopher\\'s] Sorcerer\\'s Stone \\n Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets \\n Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban \\n Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire \\n Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince \\n Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \\n It is no secret that I like these books. It took years to convince me to read them, and I only picked up once my daughter requested that we read the second one aloud at bedtime. From there, I moved quickly through the rest of the series and before I knew it, we had a Harry Potter birthday party, owned all the movies, and were carousing on Flight of the Hippogriff. How did it happen? \\n I\\'m not sure how is as important as what, here. You see, I\\'m not the only person sucked into this series, but only one of millions, completely unoriginal. Harry Potter is arguably the most successful book series ever written, popular (and fiscally dominating) with not only children, but with people of all ages. I am not as devoted to it as to Anne of Green Gables, but for the past three years I have read the complete series once a year, at a point when I most needed to escape. \\n Now, why? Harry\\'s setting is a perfectly encapsulated world, both like and unlike our own in equal measure, where one can escape for seven easily-readable books. Total immersion. Characters are fully drawn and likable (or hatable, as the need arises). Themes involve everything from death to romance to coming-of-age. And, most importantly (I think), nothing is left untied. What comes up in the first sentences resolves with the last few pages. Nothing changes. Nothing is inconsistent. It\\'s the perfect package. (Whereas miraculously nothing comes from nowhere, there are some plot lines that are extraneous and don\\'t eventually blossom, like Hermione and elf rights, or the Deathly Hallows.) \\n The main problem? Writing style. Rowling is only, prose-wise, a mediocre writer. If you are used to high literature, this can be distracting. Plot-wise Rowling is the best of writers. And character-wise, she has created some of the most memorable and iconic characters in all of literature. Plus, she\\'s made a ridiculous amount of merchandise deals and money. What any of us authors wouldn\\'t do to be her. \\n A secondary problem? Witches. Plenty of people won\\'t touch this series with a ten foot pole because they believe the occult is not a trifle. However, others have found it appropriate to draw a distinction between the true occult and the fantasy genre. Fantasy has a long history of using legendary characters-like witches-to open the imagination to possibilities and stand for moral points. These characters have become typecasts for the collective imagination and, in most cases, are no more like a \"real\" witch than Wilbur is like a real pig. You have to decide for yourself if you can go along with that. \\n One of my major beefs with this series (and something I tell myself I will never do) is the increasing age of the targeted audience as the series progresses. Sure, I understand that Harry is eleven to start and eighteen by the time it ends, but I don\\'t believe this makes it necessary to age the audience and the appropriateness level. This might have worked when Rowling was releasing and her preteen readers were aging themselves, but now, with the whole series on the bookshelf, it becomes problematic for young readers who start the series and are aged out. Aw-kward. \\n So, in short, if you haven\\'t encountered Harry Potter already, you are the only one left. If you are avoiding it, I would recommend that you stop fighting the current and make yourself finish the first two books. (The series improves as it continues.) If you have a moral objection, so be it. Otherwise, sit back and enjoy the ride. \\n * * * \\n A bonus recipe: \\n This is the butterbeer that FOX news released with the launch of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. (By the way, the park is great fun, if you happen to be in Orlando.) It is the recipe that I use each Halloween and then my family anticipates eagerly. \\n BUTTERBEER \\n In a small saucepan over medium, combine 1 cup brown sugar with 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a gentle boil and cook, stirring often, until the mixture reads 240F on a candy thermometer. \\n Stir in 6 tablespoons butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar and 1/4 cup heavy cream. Set aside to cool to room temperature. \\n Once the mixture has cooled, stir in 1/2 teaspoon rum extract. \\n In a clean, cool, medium bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar mixture and 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Use an electric mixer to beat until just thickened, but not completely whipped. \\n To serve, divide the brown sugar mixture between 4 tall glasses. Add 1 bottle premium cream soda to each glass, making sure it mixes as you pour. Spoon the whipped topping over each and enjoy the sickly sweet treat that is Butterbeer. \\n * * * \\n And a word about the movies. I appreciate them, I am addicted to them, I don\\'t love them. They are one of the only successful complete series ever made, start to finish in a timely manner. They have some issues. One, they had to be changed to fit the new format, and I miss a lot of the subtleties and minor plot lines/characters. Two, they were thrown around between directors, and combined with the aging characters and the increasing length of the books, they can be very different, especially in tone and age-appropriateness. What they do provide is a stunning display of special effects, a ridiculous cast of famous British actors, and a visual for the alternate world of Harry Potter. Watch them if you want, or don\\'t if you don\\'t. The books are still better. \\n *REVIEW WRITTEN FOR THE STARVING ARTIST BLOG., Harry is cool, loved it, My full review can be found here: \\n http://samanthatule.wordpress.com/201..., 3.5 stars., Relisten 5/21/17 \\n Reread 7/22/16 \\n Reread 12/17/14, Reread, Wow. It was worth growing up to appreciate this book fully. Slughorn is amazing, Harry (aka Roonil Wazlib) is amazing and Dumbledore is... sob, sob. \\n I wonder if Lily Evans was so great at potions because Severus was and he let her cheat, or if they shared this passion., WHYYYY? I was using this to de-stress between exams and you had to do this to me. I\\'m more stressed than I was before, how could you, J.K.Rowling? It was so unexpected and I hate Snape so much right now even though I\\'m pretty sure the next book will redeem him and I\\'m so sorry for Draco, he\\'s too young for this awful shit. And my boy, Harry James Potter was so determined at the end of the book, I could hear bad-ass songs accompanying him as he walked. But really why did she kill Dumbledore? Why does she have to kill every father figure Harry ever has? Let the boy be happy for once. And that thing with Ginny, yikes. My girl Ginny can totally take care of herself, doesn\\'t need you to break up with her, Harry Pottahhhh., One of the best of the series behind Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows. Excellent, unpredictable, and very well done. Great character development. Interesting view into Voldemort. Loved this book and love reading it again and again!, Close second favorite hp, Another great Rowling read., Probably my favorite in the series. Lots of character development and takes a darker tone., \"Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies.\" \\n 6TH YEAR AT HOGWARTS \\n This is one of my favorite books of the series so far it went by so fast for me and there were so many things I just thoroughly enjoyed. It just got a lot darker and I love how the book started off on the relationship between the muggle prime minister and the minister of magic and explaining that story which I found super interesting and I loved that time Harry got to spend with Dumbledore before leaving him of at the burrows which is always a an amazing place to be. \\n We got to see Fred and Georges joke shop which was so amazing and impressive. I felt like a proud mother. It\\'s never a normal year at Hogwarts if it doesn\\'t involve danger and security measures so naturally harry wants to get to the bottom of it. \\n Reading so much more about Tom Riddles past and story was so interesting and all the things he went through just to get to where he is now. \\n It was also very frustrating how harry was spending all his time doing 5 things at once but no one around him seemed to believe him about Snape or Draco. Dumbledore never telling Harry when he already knew almost everything it would have saved so much more time especially learning about the Horcruxes which by the way was so cool. \\n \"Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. Ghosts are transparent.\" \\n One thing I completely enjoyed was the romance in this book. Harry having this sudden urge of jealousy towards Dean and Ginny and Ron looking after her sister, Ron making out with Lavender every five seconds and it hurt me so much to see Hermione in pain, Harry actually in a relationship with Ginny which I totally fangirled about once it happened. Just so many emotions running through my head. \\n One of my favorite scenes in this book was when Harry asked Luna to go to one of Slughorn\\'s parties with him as friends and it just proves she\\'s become one of my favorite characters. \\n \"Nobody\\'s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend. Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I do mine too?\" \\n Obviously the ending was so sad and hurtful and my heart felt betrayed but I knew it was coming and I could do nothing to stop it I guess that\\'s why it took me so long to finish the book because I kept putting of the ending. \\n I guess one thing that kept me happy by the end was Bill and Fleur\\'s wedding which I\\'m ecstatic for., not as good as #5, but the addiction is still strong...and now that Karin loaned me #7, I\\'m on track to be as gaga as the rest of you. But they are lots less fun now that he has a sense of Responsibility and Justice. \\n Ugh. Too Madeline L\\'Engleish for me. I prefer the Roald Dahl approach - no moral, except that the Grownups Must Die., re-read via audiobook for the nth time. Stephen Fry as narrator., I love this series so much! I am so sad that I only have 759 pages of this story to go. Wow! This was a brilliant idea by a brilliant author. This is how a series should be done., Can you marry a book? Because I want to marry this one! \\n The three stages of reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince : \\n 1)Laugh so hard I couldn\\'t breath \\n 2) Read maniacally \\n 3) Ugly cry and feelings that life is over \\n My current state: \\n I AM AFRAID FOR EVERYONE\\'S FUTURE RIGHT NOW!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I really liked this book, was shocked when Dumbledore was killed, didn\\'t want to believe it. But I enjoyed this book a great deal., (Spoiler alert!) \\n So I don\\'t really understand this, but the first couple of times I read this, I didn\\'t cry at all when Dumbledore died. The first time I was shocked and saddened, but, very strangely for me, didn\\'t cry. But now that I\\'ve read the 7th book and know that he was going to die anyways, I\\'ve been bawling. Strange, yes? \\n This one is actually happy -I mean, besides the annual big-huge-fight- and that\\'s very nice, especially since the 7th book is so...dreary, shall we say? \\n There are parts that are...not exactly scary, more like very tense. And they make me shiver even though its 75 degrees outside: specifically, the chapter \"The Cave\". \\n Also, Harry and Ginny! So cute!, Ok, I actually did cry at the end of this one. But I won\\'t reveal why because there are those deprived souls out there who have not experienced the magic that is Harry Potter. I am still entirely devoted to Severus Snape despite the unexpected ending of this book. He\\'s good., I am dieing to know what happens!, This is when Rowling really focused on the finish. No more f-ing around. This woman had a job to do. \\n In a way, I was glad the sports championships, tournaments and other silly asides were done with. On the other hand, the story became singleminded in scope. As readers we were no longer inhabiting the world of Harry Potter, we were now on a quest. As much as I\\'ve complained about those silly asides, I realized after finishing this book (and especially after the next one) that I missed them. Diversions done well are a nice relief and can add so much depth to story and character. \\n If there is something to be said about the story and character of Harry Potter, it\\'s that our boy is all growed up. Book #6 is a far cry from #1. \\n A big and important step is taken in the The Half-Blood Prince. Rowling shows she is not afraid to kill off her most precious babies. Some would say the series had to end at some point and that the killings were not so bold. Ah, but many a publishing and movie executive would disagree and cry out, \"Why?! Why kill the cash cow?!?!\" Well, she did. Finally Rowling did kill it. She brought this whole satisfying series to an end, and this is its beginning., This book is so moving. The end is so strong and powerful. There is no book like this. Amazing!!, Bloated, but perhaps my favorite of the Potter books., For the love of Christ, we\\'re almost done reading these to our kids. This one was actually much better than it\\'s crappy predecessor. Some cool revelations about the big baddie and some sweet-ass wizard battles. Plus, Snape! Rowling wasn\\'t afraid to kill off main characters, either, though it was unavoidable and kind of predictable mostly because other kids keep ruining the story for us. On the negative side, the pacing is off, all the interesting characters are completely left out and even Ron and Hermione just sort of simper around whining a lot. I\\'d Crucio those two into oblivion., \"Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world\". I\\'ve totally forgotten how much I\\'d enjoyed this one and how angry the last chapters had made me. Has taken me 10 years to re-read it for various reasons, but I am so glad I finally did., Yes, Deathly Hallows was a bucketful of sadness, but really Half-Blood Prince had to be the saddest of all. I won\\'t give anything away, but I totally cried at the end and am not ashamed to admit it. While others thought there was too much backstory, I loved it, it gives the series the much needed canon it deserves., More than a prelude to the epic conclusion of Harry Potter\\'s adventures, \"The Half-Blood Prince\" achieves a remarkable balance between the epic and down-to-earth elements, between the public and the private, as Harry Potter and his friends face a dauting passage into adulthood. Whereas in previous volumes, the return of Voldemort seemed to affect no more than the Wizarding world, we know begin to realize that it also has deep and often painful implications for everyone, both in the Wizarding and the Muggle worlds (as is clearly established in the first chapter), both among Harry Potter\\'s inner circle and way beyond it. Of course, the political schemes of the Ministry of Magic and the dark plots of the Death-Eaters are cleverly balanced with a healthy, and actually heart-warming reminder that Harry and his friends are as much teenager, as they are students of wizardy. Fortunately, Harry\\'s emo phase is over in this book, so his tantrums are mostly replaced by a more focused sense of justice (particularly, once he realizes that he isn\\'t the only one that was hurt by Sirius\\'s death, and that he can be a hero by choice, not only because a prophecy seems seems to say he should be), and his \"hero complex\" is nicely balanced by his growing feelings for Ginny. The way that his falling in love is revealed and described is one of the crowning achievements of the book, at a par with or higher than the gradual discovery of Voldemort\\'s origins. At is core, the Harry Potter books are the tale of two boys who, faced with very similar choices and situations early in life, take two very different paths, and Harry\\'s capacity to trust and stand by his friends (although at times hindered by arguments and different points of view, but then they are his friends, not his followers or servants) makes all the difference in the world. \"It was almost like having friends\" says outcast Luna Lovegood, reminicing the meetings of Dumbledore\\'s Army in \"The Order of the Phoenix\", in one of the most touching moments in the whole series. Certainly, Rowling can be still accused of making things up as needed, regardless of the consistency of individual elements with the picture of Hogwart\\'s world (particularly, when it comes to spells that solve a specific problem and that never been hinted in previous books, despite their obvious usefulness, as well as the arbitrary use of magic for menial tasks), she certainly was able to create flesh-and-blood characters with whom we could symphatize or whom we could loathe or be afraid of., Warning: This review contains plot spoilers for the few who haven\\'t read the book. \\n The Half-Blood Prince was one of my favorite books in the series, starting Snape\\'s curious meeting with Bellatrix and Narcissa, followed by Dumbledore\\'s adventures for Harry to pay a visit to Professor Slughorn, quite the funny character and the new Potions teacher, and with Snape becoming the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher in Harry, Hermione and Ron\\'s 6th year at Hogwarts. \\n The plot against Snape thickens and since I hardly remember the movie plot line (all the better), I can\\'t quite remember how Snape manages to come out clean later, and the relationship between Dumbledore and Harry grows stronger. Harry gets a lucky break with becoming really good at creating fancy potions thanks to his copy of the Half-blood prince book, and he even gets somewhat lucky in love as his feelings for Ginny start to develop. At the same time, it\\'s amusing to read the bickering between Hermione and Ron, knowing full well - even if they don\\'t at this stage - that it develops into something stronger and better. \\n The tasks before Harry - set forth by Dumbledore during their many secret meetings - are challenging enough even for super-smart Hermione to figure out, and in the end, the solution to extract Slughorn\\'s memory is so very brilliantly delivered. What I most, most enjoyed in this book were the darkest parts: The travels down memory lane and the magic of the Pensieve in Dumbledore\\'s study. In this book, we also learn way more about Voldemort\\'s past starting with his family and pre-birth. How is it possible that we could even feel some empathy for someone so evil. Only an accomplished author can do that for me. Going back to the very beginning of VolThe balance between plot and story is extremely well-done in this book. \\n The adventures and disasters continue to mount and keep you fascinated by what\\'s coming next, as do the themes and the underlying messages that Rowling carefully feeds to our hungry hearts. Her themes of friendship, loyalty, trust, the power of choice, the weight of responsibility show up again and again as we follow the growing pains of our favorite characters in the Half-Blood Prince. \\n The theme that most prominently shows up in this book and all the others is the power of love. If you have been loved and nurtured as a child and into adulthood, even if that love was in small supply as in the case of Harry, you are essentially good, pure, and protected and as Dumbledore points out, despite everything - all the loss and pain - that Harry went through, he was still pure at heart because of LOVE, the love that his mother had given him at the age of one. \\n On the other hand, if you have been abandoned, hurt, neglected, and cast aside even before you were born into this world, you are faced with difficult but simple choices, and a very few lean towards vengeance, anger, and even extremes of evil as did Voldemort. \\n The ending of Book 6 was very sad. I cried more for what happened to Bill Weasley than what happened to Dumbledore and neither was in the least expected. Sigh! Get some tissues. \\n Exquisitely written. Brilliantly executed. JK Rowling is one in a billion. I\\'m well into Book 7 and loving it., Gradually, I think these books got worse and worse. I felt like Rowling lost track of her own characters. \\n EDIT: Upon actually reading the book again, and finishing it all the way this time, I can say that I really didn\\'t mind it. Although I still don\\'t care much for the way Rowling\\'s characters began to act, I did enjoy this book., I feel betrayed!!! This will no doubt be the root of all my trust issues..., Impressive!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n One of my top 3 Harry Potter books, but I cried when Dumbledore died. Poor thing., Second read: \\n Still fantastic, obviously. The plot is pretty long and drawn out with nothing happening for a while but Rowling JUST picks it up in exactly the right spot before it begins to get boring. Her brilliance in writing really shows how she can carry 500+ pages with very little excitement and still make it a page turner. The ending really makes the book where all the hints and mysteries comes together in such a perfect way where so many characters change and so much happens, I felt like I read the last 100 pages in five minutes I just couldn\\'t stop. \\n First read: \\n Another fantastic addition in the HP series. Unbridled intensity, plot developments galore, brilliant characters and dialogue, strange and amazing environments...all standard HP brilliance. This book, however, did suffer from just too much shallow teen romance, re-hashing the same stereotypical gendered bullshit of boys being dumb and girls crying all the time that never happens in real life. There was too much dating early and mid book and it just seemed like filler. I understand it fits in their development as teenagers...but it could have been done a lot better. Other than that the book was great and, obviously, a great addition to the series., I saw the movie before I ever read the book! \\n There were parts of the book I was anticipating because I had already seen the film, but nothing I have read compares to the movie! \\n The ending of this book brought me to tears! Mind you I have seen the movie so I knew what was going to happen, but I could not stop the waterfall of tears that came! \\n I had a few problems with book especially with the characters! I really did not love any of them in this book! Harry, who will forever remain my favorite character, was too obsessed with finding proof that Malfoy was a Death Eater. I found myself for the majority of the book shaking my head, I felt like he was too determined and sure of himself that it became annoying to read every other line how he was going to catch him. I felt half the time he did not take things seriously and his obsession with the \\'Half Blood Prince\\'s\\' potion book added more to his problem. I couldn\\'t stand to watch him destroy himself over the book and abuse it\\'s capability. \\n Hermione, I don\\'t know where to start with her. She was such a PRAT! I\\'m sorry to those that love Hermione, I DO NOT like her in the books at all! She is an annoying know-it-all and she seems to want to outsmart everyone else. She especially showed her true colors during their time in potions class. I can understand in taking pride in knowing everything, but I feel she abuses it so much that it\\'s almost tedious and such a waste for me to read especially if she\\'s going to be an annoying little brat. UGH and they way she treated Ron, I couldn\\'t stand it. I wanted to yell at her and say \\'admit you love the damn fool you good for nothing stubborn prat\\'. I couldn\\'t stand her for the majority of the book because she had to be right about everything and to lecture everyone about their decisions UGH it made me want to smack her half the time. \\n Ron, oh Ron so oblivious to everything. I wish we got to have more chapters with him in it, but none the less I don\\'t know what to say about him. Love Ron. \\n I HATE SNAPE FOREVER. \\n Overall, this book was so much better than the movie and I will cherish these books forever! I\\'m off to read the last book in this series! I am determined to finish!, Loved this book, but not as good as the earlier Harry Potters., MY FAVORITE FROM THE WHOLE SERIES. DRACO IS AMAZING OK., ** spoiler alert ** \\n OH MY GOSH! It was so hard seeing Dumbeldore die and I\\'m so confused about why Snape killed him! But god, I can\\'t wait to read the last book and see the movie! GO RON AND HERMOINE! They rock! (Even though they aren\\'t together yet, it\\'s darn obvious they will be. Ginny and Harry, IDK about them.. they don\\'t have much chemistry. (I guess though it\\'s because Harry is becoming so increasingly focused on his future destiny with Lord Voldemort. I never knew that I would become such a Harry Potter fanatic in only about 2-3 months of trying to finish the books but darn the series is so great!!, 7/3/07 \\n 11/10/10 - This one is so heavy, that I quite appreciated the light-heartedness of the hormone stuff. I like how the lovey-dovey stuff is kinda slowly been building up. I adore Ron and Hermione together. I like Ginny and Harry together. I loved the scene at the end with Fleur in the hospital wing. I loved Luna and I want to hear more about Neville. I find at the end of this one, I don\\'t have a whole lot to say about it. I liked it of course, but mostly I\\'m just anxious to get to the last one. I\\'ve only read it once and honestly, I kinda rushed through it. \\n 12/26/12 - This was my first read-aloud of this book. I don\\'t remember if the end choked me up this much before, but it definitely did this time. I had a hard time getting through it! My Little was a little sad at the top of the astronomy tower too, but the aftermath didn\\'t seem to bother her as much. We immediately started Deathly Hallows. \\n 7/8/16 - Still loved it. :), I read this to check if it was suitable for a primary school library because I had to., ** spoiler alert ** \\n This book sad because of Professor Dumbledore death. Also dark evil starts happening. This Harry Potter book leads up to the Deathly Hollow., Relectura 24601: \\n No quiero que Draco Malfoy me de pena, por que tiene que darme pena, no quiero!!!! \\n Este libro tiene las dos mejores cosas de la saga: Harry diciendole a Snape \"there\\'s no need to call me \"sir\", professor\" y la nota de Regulus diciendole a Voldy: \"que te den\" y eso me gusta. \\n Tom Riddle de peque me parece fascinante. \\n Bill y Fleur son mega OTP pero me parece que la relacion de Lupin y Tonks esta forzadisima. \\n Not enough Neville. \\n En el proximo libro todos mis favs mueren :D, Dumbledore died. :( Out of the characters he was one of my favorites. \\n If he hadn\\'t died I might have added another star to my rating. \\n I really don\\'t enjoy this series though I still carried on reading it anyway, it\\'s a well written book there\\'s nothing wrong with it in that respect, it\\'s just it\\'s not the book for me. \\n Sorry only 1 star off me., Rereading these books I find myself increasingly impressed by Rowling. The flashbacks to Tom Riddle\\'s youth don\\'t tell us anything essential to the story (except for the horcrux revelation) but they still held me (it helps that he comes across entirely believable as the boy who will become Voldemort). The search for the first horcrux is intense. And she really makes Dumbledore, who could easily be a cliche, believable as the dignified, all-wise headmaster. Plus generally a great read., This 6o book is a brilliant and captivating addiction to series that so many people have grown to love all over the world. Harry Potter\\'s world is just pure genius.The characters are fantastic and both Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort are super complex characters. For me the Harry Potter books are the best books ever written, the world created by the author is amazing and the story is breathtaking, I loved every one of them (books, characters,world). This book was one of my favorites of the series., I dragged my feet with this book, but not because it was slow. I dragged my feet because I don\\'t want to end this journey that I\\'ve been enjoying! I am sad that it is another book closer to the end of this amazing book series. \\n The Half-Blood Prince is my favourite movie of the franchise. I am struggling to choose my favourite book though, because each one gave so much detail to help me understand the story and each book contained a vital piece of information to complete the puzzle., Of course I\\'m giving a Harry Potter novel 5 stars. None of them will get a lower ranking from me, I\\'m reading the whole series again because I\\'m a dork like that but I got 200 pages in and realized I skipped Order of the Phoenix............, Re-reading this as an adult made me appreciate how much the characters came of age in the book., Just crying in the back of work, now., One of my favorite in the series. We learn much and also leave the story with many more questions. Rowling draws closed the web she has created throughout the series ensuring the reader will be eager to follow the Trio into the last book in the series., I am reading this again before I see the movie! I know, I know. Late. Oh well!, nice..good one.., Honestly this is the best Harry Potter book I have read. Even though I had been spoiled before about a major death. My body still wasn\\'t ready for it. This book. Takes twist and turns and fleshes out Voldemort more than ever, I\\'m so miserable right now, I have been crying for fifteen minutes, and I feel like a little kid who has just grown up all at once. I love these books more than words can express., ending, plot, theme, characters (thumbs up!), Harry just go sit in a corner please! No one likes you except Ginny okay now deal with that while I talk about this book. \\n So obviously from the start of this review you can tell I didn\\'t like Harry in it. All he does is shut out everyone who loves him and genuinely cares. He is moody, angry and treats his friends like dirt. I really hated the way JK portrayed him in the last couple of books. I like this book but not Harry. I\\'m sorry., Christmas break is the perfect time to read this sort of thing (especially since I also had to re-read the fifth book to refresh my memory). These terrible obsessions can\\'t possibly be quenched somewhat and then put to rest during regular working days, oh no. Holidays are the only time for it, and only if you don\\'t have much else planned., Started to read this while in labor with my second daughter. It was the perfect distraction!, Snape is the best!, <3 \\n <3 \\n <3, Not my favorite, but still wonderful., Always amazing - even the third time around!, The HBP is definitely one of the darkest of the Harry Potter books, especially the parts when Dumbledore and Harry look into Voldemort\\'s (*Cough* Tom Riddle\\'s)past. I think my favourite parts of the book are Slughorn\\'s Christmas party and the battle at the end! And I also loved this book because now I can jump into the last book for the second time. Yay! :), YES, the story continues... \\n Probably my least favorite of all the Potter books. But necessary! It led us to the awesome ending. \\n (and NO! This book didn\\'t cause me to become a Wizard/witch and worship Satan... \"What\\'s that? You need help getting the Goat onto the B.B.Q. for tonight\\'s ritual?\" Be right there., Harry Potter\\'s fame has grown even higher after the fiasco at the Ministry of Magic, where the magic world at last comes to believe what he has been telling them all year - that Voldemort\\'s back. But now it seems Malfoy\\'s up to something and again only Harry seems to take it seriously. Back in Hogwarts, they now have a new potions teacher or rather an old one out from retirement. Snape also finally gets the defence against the dark arts job he\\'s been wanting - but don\\'t they only last for one year? Oh, yes they do and finally we get to know why! \\n There are love affairs brewing, there are near death attacks on students, and we also get to learn much about Voldemort\\'s history. We then get to know what Malfoy\\'s been up to and its no good at all! Hogwarts is breached, Snape shows his true loyalty, and......and........and Dumble....Dumbledore...........dies!, The penultimate Harry Potter novel. This one explores Lord Voldemort\\'s past, develops (and dissolves) multiple romantic relationships amongst the characters and also features some pretty righteous fight scenes. \\n It is Harry\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts, and things have gotten more complicated, dramatic and dark with each year. This book definitely doesn\\'t disappoint - I was actually a bit surprised with some of the profanity and violent scenes toward the end. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have anything against violence or profanity in works of art, but I thought this was supposed to be a Young Adult novel? At any rate, the atmosphere of this book is probably the darkest and most evil yet. I assume this will most likely continue in the seventh (and final) book. \\n I couldn\\'t really say that this is my favorite Harry Potter book in the series. It was very good, but I think I enjoyed some of the lighter fun had in the earlier books. As usual, there is a bit of a setup in the beginning that adds a new twist, a train ride to Hogwarts, a year of school, a terrific climax involving Harry and the end of the school year. What was interesting to me was how much was left out of the normal formula in this book and the sort of things that were added in. It seems to break the mold a bit, which I liked. \\n 4/5 Stars. 652 pages. Published 2005., absolutely heart wrenching, but such a good story! JK Rowling is a gifted storyteller...her Harry Potter books get better with each story!, Re read aug 5 2013 p. 652. Re-read 1/10/17., oh wow. is snape evil or is he good? \\n ?!?!?! \\n i can\\'t decide. rowling has done a really phenomenal job setting that up. at this point i think he\\'s evil, because otherwise wouldn\\'t dumbledore have confided to harry or another member of the order of the phoenix why he trusts snape so implicitly? i think harry\\'s excuse is bogus, i think snape had to have told dumbledore something better than \"it was me who betrayed to prophecy to voldemort\". \\n i just preordered book 7!, This is a really good book. It doesn\\'t have that much action in it though. I think it\\'s REALLY sad when Dumbledore dies. :( I almost cried the second time I read it, Another excellent adventure for Harry and friends., This is by far my favourite harry potter book! I love it way too much! \\n I\\'ve cried so hard! Dombuldore dying just broke my heart \\n A lot happen in this book, new amazing spells like Sectunsempra just for enemies and more! \\n Now, after Ive read this book again, now that Im twenty years old I just feel pity for Draco, I think all he\\'s ever done it\\'s to make his father proud but Lucious is just a snake sun of a bitch who desn\\'t give a fuck for his son. Because if I was him, I would hide my son from the shadow of the dark one. \\n About Snape, I know how this ends! but I can\\'t help myself from hating him in this book., Definitely good to re-read this one before getting into Deathly Hallows..., I love HP! It will always have a place in my heart!, Absolutely loved this one! The Harry Potter series just keeps getting better. It\\'s hard to give comments on this one without giving away any spoilers! Can\\'t wait to read the next book and am looking forward to the movie coming out this summer!, My favorite book out of the series simply because of the Snapey bits! woohoo, This book explores the past of Voldemort and gives us priceless information about the Dark Lord. Harry spends a great deal of time with Dumbledore, as he tries to aid him in his secret mission. The loss of Sirius is still causing Harry pain and loss and grief strike him again, when his mentor falls off the Astronomy Tower one fateful night., Alliance. \\n For the almost end of the saga, this book draws the reader, through the last year Harry and his 2 inseparable friends spend at Hogwarts, unknowingly. \\n Voldemort\\'s horror campaign has been extending and the whole magical community is shaking in fright. \\n And at Hogwarts things are not better, several attacks, a new teacher, suspicion over Draco and Snape, and teenage love interests. \\n It all mixes up in a winding of emotions and surprises as the story continues, for another secret is exposed; the way Voldemort should be killed which takes Harry and Dumbledore in the quest for several magic objects called Horcruxes. \\n In the end, a horrible dead casts its shadow upon Hogwarts as the magical world loses one of the greatest wizards ever. Which will only mean one thing: the war is just starting., Please read this to do yourself a favor, I think this one was my favorite., I reread this after I saw the movie last Saturday. They sure had to leave out alot, but then the movie was over 2 and 1/2 hours. The movie played up the romance and down the fighting. Not a bad thing and it did advance the plot, but like always THE Book is better!!, I liked this because of Snape and all those realizations XD Gosh it\\'s been a long time, Did not enjoy the research that happened in this story. I know it was necessary, but it was incredibly boring and painful in my opinion. I guess I was used to more action from previous books happening. This book had a completely different feel from the others., already on shelf... have not read it... :(, ** spoiler alert ** \\n This one WOULD lose a star because Dumbledore dies if not for what happens with snape in the next book., This is the second time I read it, and I loved it, I always cry at the end., [RE-READ] \\n Dumbledore\\'s man through and through., ** spoiler alert ** \\n This one was cool too--not my favorite, but still really awesome!!! I can\\'t believe Dumbledor died--and for real too!!!, I really enjoyed this book compared to book five in the series. I think it mainly had to do with the fact that Harry wasn\\'t being a jerk to his friends anymore, Dumbledore was an active part of his life again, Ron and Hermoine started to show their feelings for each other, and Ginny and Harry finally hooked up (as well as Tonks and Lupin) There was a lot of love and action in this book to keep the pages turning. It was also very interesting to see Voldemort more as a person in the memories than a snake-like creature-man. Kind of humanized him a bit so it feels like Harry has a chance. I remember crying my eyes out the first time I read it when Dumbledore died, but I think with how many times I\\'ve seen the movie and knew it was coming, I didn\\'t get as emotional. This is probably my favorite Harry Potter books so far, aside from the first one., I liked it, but it wasn\\'t as exiting as the others. \\n My least favorite of the series., Tears indeed., Best of the series!, amazing... sad!, Good book probably one of my favorite Harry Potter., Only read it because I was seeing the movie., yay good book. must read it now!, I read this again, as I\\'ve been reading the series again since March...and the story is worth all 5 stars. Everything makes perfect sense after all these years. The series is just so awesome., Minor possible spoiler alert: \\n This was the 2nd time that I read this book -- this time aloud to my family (husband, daughter, and sometimes-listening 4 year-old son). Compared to the readings of the first 5 books in this series, my daughter (now 8) was much better able to follow the story, even if she didn\\'t quite get all of the romantic and social issues with Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny. I have to say, it was really hard to read the last chapter aloud without choking up., Not my favorite book in this series. Rowling made Harry look as if he had never learned any magical skills in this book. Very disappointing read. I found myself angry at the author when I finished this book., Re-read again.., I love all the Harry Potter books, and this one was just as awesome as the rest. Anyone who like fantasy would love this series. The books are way better than the movies, with much more detail., RE-READ: \\n Half-Blood Prince was not my favorite book when I first read it in high school, but as a shiny thirty-something adult, I feel like I appreciated it more this time. \\n I still love Draco\\'s arc and the connection he builds with Moaning Myrtle. I love the information we get about Tom Riddle and how he came to be the villain he is. I loved seeing more of Dumbledore and Harry. I loved that Grawp was at Dumbledore\\'s funeral in a close approximation of a suit. I love how we finally got Remus and Tonks, which was a pairing I didn\\'t even know I wanted until it happened. \\n I even love the silliness and the evolution of teenage love/relationships (Ron/Lavender, the disaster that was Hermione/Cormac, and Harry/Ginny.) \\n Inferi are creepy and terrifying. \\n Fenrir Greyback is creepy and terrifying. \\n Dumbledore\\'s death still crushes me every time., WAAAH. Six down, one to go. Maybe I can accomplish the goal of finishing them all before the end of this year?, ** spoiler alert ** \\n Harry and Ginny (: <3333 so cute, 5/5, No complaints. This was the meat and potatoes of the story. sh!t got real then went off the handle. Gosh what an ending. My emotions are all over the place... \\n see you in the next review., Well....you know, Why have I spent the last few years telling everyone that this book was my least favorite in the series?! It was SO GOOD., I re-read this after watching the movie. Makes me want to re-read the 7th book now. But I am going to resist for a little while. Too much other stuff that is too good to just spend a couple week re-reading books that I have already read twice before. The movie was good, but the book is so much more than the movie could be., I wanted to reread this before the movie came out. I forgot how sad I was when Dumbledore dies., Im... shook... no one talk to me... i\\'m in denial, This is my favorite happy potter book. just finished reading it the second time, preparing for the summer release of the movie. I believe all the effort put in finding the history of \"you know who\" is crucial information and i am glad to see there are more to learn than just relying on the mysterious luck by being \"the chosen one\". I feel really sad when Dumbledore died in the end, but I think that is the only way Harry can grow, be strong and independent. Dumbledore says \"It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\" The story finally shows love makes Harry choose to fight, not because he has to, or he can., so yeah okay harry potter is amazing. who knew?, \"A must read for all ages I\\'m 34 and have read all 7 books countless of times I love them all & now my 12 year old son loves them too deffo my favourite books!!!\", 4.5. Sigh . . . Dumbledore. So much more info in these books than the movies. If you like the movies but have never read the series, I suggest you read it., Full of action and this part is revealing more and more secrets. Really like that :), I like this one a lot, nearly as much as OOtP. I do like that she allowed them one last moment of relative levity before the final fight. However, the Harry/Ginny romancin\\' leaves me a little cold, simply because she\\'s been such a bit part up until about half-way through this book. I like her - a lot - and I get why Harry would too. However, she\\'s not been on-screen enough for me to form an actual attachment to, and so it seems somewhat rushed. But it\\'s not a huge complaint!, Definitely a massive improvement on the disappointment that was \\'The Order Of The Phoenix\\'. \\n Whilst a good read it only gets four stars because it reads more as a prologue to the Deathly Hallows rather than a standalone-ish story like the first four books in the series. \\n Overall though this is a success, almost as lengthy as the Order Of The Phoenix but thankfully not at all long-winded. A very good and unexpected ending. \\n As usual with the series, J.K. Rowling makes one feel empathy with the characters and their struggles against the Dark Lord. \\n This will always be my favourite childhood series., I\\'ve really been enjoying Rowling\\'s later books--her writing is more complex and poetic, and she is not afraid to go places where her earlier books didn\\'t. She has such a grasp of plot and a talent for weaving myriad elements together almost seamlessly. Great book! I will be sad to see the series end., I really loved rereading this one. After a year of turmoil at Hogwarts in the form of Umbridge, it was nice to return to business as usual - as usual as it could be with the rise of dark forces outside the school. Love the pensieve, love the glimpses into Voldemort\\'s family - giving Voldemort backstory allows us to understand him better and will make the final battle more meaningful. Also the romance/snogging was adorable (they are 16 now, after all)., People I trust on matters Potter told me I\\'d like this one a lot better than, say, the last two Harrys, those people were right. Well, mostly. \\n I am, though, getting some Potter fatigue. \\n So while I\\'m delighted to see Fred and George running their joke shop, and to start off a book from the Muggle Prime Minister\\'s point of view, and all the other charming little humorous nuggets* that make a Potter book a Potter book, there are some other things that I don\\'t find quite so charming. By which I mean, things that threaten the willing suspension of disbelief that is vital to the enjoyment of books such as these. By which I mean, well, consarn it, after five books and how many encounters with the bad stuff again, mightn\\'t one reasonably expect that when the boy with the Dark Lord-detecting scar right on his forehead says something might be fishy, someone might at least be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and check it out? Even if it\\'s just one of his classmates? \\n But no. Here\\'s another plot that depends largely on Harry\\'s being right and nobody with authority believing him until it\\'s too late. Sigh. \\n Also, I\\'m seriously missing a certain character whose name I\\'ll not disclose to avoid spoilers even though I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m the last person in the world to read these books. Portrayed magnificently, if sparingly** by Gary Oldman in the films. Sob. \\n BUT, I can forgive a lot of this because of the inventiveness of this book\\'s big plot MacGuffin: the advanced potions textbook, via which a long-ago titular \"prince\" communicates with Harry and which satisfies a longing I\\'ve had since the first book: for a look at the creative process behind all of these spells and recipes these kids have been struggling to master and memorize for hundreds of pages. There was a glimpse of that in the Weasley Twins\\' gags, but that was just a tease. Of course. \\n The mystery behind who made all of those margin notes that have turned Harry from a potions duffer to a potions superstar is the most intriguing one so far. Who was it? What became of that person? What were his or her motives? Is there any relationship to a certain other book that caused all kinds of ruckus in the second novel?*** This is the most original bit of plotting Rowling has done -- which is a good thing because otherwise, this book is a bit dismal, even dull. The other main plot (or what should have been the other main plot instead of the tedious All About Voldemort exposition) involving a student who was obviously originally intended to be a serious rival for Harry at the school but who had degenerated into a bit of hum-drum caricature a long time ago, finally seeming to rise to the status of actual villain, fell a bit flat for me, mostly because it was sidelined by the romantic escapades of the Main Trio. I feel a bit cheated by this; that whole story is told second-hand at the end, Scooby-Doo style. I would rather have read that story than about teenage soap opera romance, even with magic wands. \\n Do members of Rowling\\'s intended audience really prefer will-they-won\\'t they to werewolf attacks and kid wizards trying to become eeeevil? \\n The main surprise of the book, which defines this one for most people I am sure, was spoiled for me long ago, of course, but was still moving. Even if it hadn\\'t been spoiled for me, I expected it in any case; in the Hero\\'s Journey, he always loses his mentor before his greatest challenge. I was, though, mercifully still in the dark as to how this loss was going to happen, so it still managed to be a bit of an enjoyable shock, even though the betrayal had been pretty much foreshadowed for five books already. \\n So now the decks are cleared, the furniture stowed, the cutlasses out, the drums pounding, the powder and shot lined up by the cannons -- and the crew arguing with Captain Harry about whether he can really sail the ship alone, especially since he doesn\\'t have a course to go with his mission. Bring on Deathly Hallows. \\n *Some of which might not be intentional? I\\'m still looking at about page 110 when Ron and Harry buy a large bag of owl nuts. Um. \\n **There is not enough Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman should be in all the films. \\n ***But the answer turned out to be kind of nonsensical. An early candidate for the real identity of the Half-Blood Prince was ruled out based on the timing of the book\\'s publication, but then the actual prince turned out to be someone pretty much the same age as the eliminated candidate. Um., Re-reading on the 10th anniversary-- this was a very good book, but overshadowed, in retrospect, by the final book. Rowling put together a terrific series!, Buku keenam Harry Potter yang tebalnya luar biasa untuk ukuran novel. Memakan waktu 2 hari penuh untuk pembaca cepat seperti saya membacanya dan perlu seminggu untuk benar-benar menikmatinya. Tetapi tenggang waktu antara penerbitan buku satu dan yang lainnya sedikit banyak mengurangi ingatan juga akan adegan terakhir dari buku sebelumnya (he..he..he... kalau itu sih mungkin terpengaruh usia...)Saya tidak sabar menunggu buku berikutnya., Oh boy what a pleasant surprise! I have been avoiding this series despite my sons raving. And although I started at 6 -because I didn\\'t know the story yet - I was enthralled through the entire book., This is my least favorite of the HP books. It deals with Harry\\'s being given a used potions book that has lots of added inscriptions by its prior user the half blood prince. Dumbledore has finally decided to offer HP some private time but the time is spent looking at people\\'s memories of Tom Riddal\\'s early life and his time at Hogwart\\'s. Interspersed with the two above motifs is Draco\\'s mission for Voldemort and Snape\\'s duplicitous support of Draco., Never will my heart be the same., Depressing but great., Just finished the audio this morning...Robby and I are loving it! We are heading right into the grand finale!, one of my favourites from the series, Oh my god , amazing, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was amazing! J.K. Rowling is such a talented author! \\n She breathes new light onto both Voldemort and Snape and you learn more about them (more about Voldemort than Snape). The love stories in this book were definately a nice addition in the more serious atmosphere. Ron was, as always, the comical relief. \\n I really enjoyed seeing Fred and George\\'s shop. That was a great detail to the series that I think every reader was definately waiting for. Everything with Voldemort gets more complicated as you read this book though. Interesting but complicated. It\\'s a good complicated though. You can still understand everything but the world of Harry Potter is definately well-thought out., Wanted to catch up before the movie came out this summer. I was inspired to do a poll on Tales Treehouse about the \"best worst villain.\", Reread: December 7, 2016- December 10, 2016, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is the sixth installment in the HP series. The wizarding world is in shambles, half of Diagon Alley is closed down, and everyone is living in terror that the dark mark will appear over their house next. Professor Horace Slughorn has resumed his old position as potions master, leaving the defense against the dark arts post to Snape. Harry has begun private lessons with Dumbledore, and has discovered one of Voldemort\\'s biggest secret, horcruxes. All this on top of a year of advance potions, though Harry is getting a lot of help in that subject from mysterious Half Blood Prince., Yo estaba segura desde el principio que este libro iba a ser increible. \\n Y no me equivoque. \\n Cada pagina estuvo llena de cosas nuevas, de emociones, de situaciones que no habian quedado solventadas en los libros anteriores, tuve la oportunidad de conocer mas a fondo la personalidad de los personajes. Fue simplemente una lectura perfecta de principio a fin., ** spoiler alert ** \\n 8/24/2014 \\n Reading it this time, it hit me why it felt so right that Harry and Ginny end up together. Some people see Harry as this Frodo-like character or Jesus that has to take the journey alone, but I see it as he\\'s supposed to be an ordinary person, whom extraordinary things happen to. Yes, he was chosen for this journey but he was not necessarily prophesied for it. I also think he\\'s far more human than Frodo - he leans on Hermione and Ron for so much support, he doesn\\'t bear the whole matter all on his shoulders. Sure, in the final steps he appears to, but even then, he leans on the support of his parents and Sirius and Remus and their love helps to push him forward. \\n 1/6/2009 \\n Snape kills Dumbledore on page 594 - I just saved you $30 and 10 hours...kidding! \\n The funeral scene was so much harder for me to read this time because I know what it feels like to have to sit through a funeral of someone you\\'re so close to now - it\\'s amazing to me how, even having read the series so many times, my view on it changes each time I read it because my life expereinces are so different. \\n That\\'s what is great about Rowling\\'s writing, I think. It keeps changing with you, as you change because the characters and situations are so real and human (Muggle-like, if you will) even though it\\'s set in this really magical world that some of us could never imagine., I LOVED this book. I bought it as soon as it came out and read it all in one day/night. Luckily I didn\\'t have to work the next day. \\n I was soo upset that Dumbledore died. But like most people I knew there had to be a reason why Snape killed him. I just couldn\\'t accept that Snape was a traitor., Snape. \\n Snape. \\n Severus Snape. \\n Master at potions? Harry?? Okay. \\n He finds a book filled with different directions and new spells. This helps him become a favorite of the new Potions teacher. Of course, Hermione is jealous. Ron is his usual mad self. \\n It is another adventure at Hogwarts. \\n Be prepared for some tears., No Comment...., These books continue to be incredible. I don\\'t think that will ever change..., This is the best one so far... I loved each and every part of this book. Amazing, just... PERFECT!, Still like Goblet of Fire better, but this is a VERY close second. \\n Good stuff, J.K.!, Couldnt put it down once started reading it ... simply great !!!, Oh, Harry. Sometimes you just don\\'t see what\\'s right in front of your face., Still amazing. And I still cried. Again. And Ginny is way cooler than I remember., OK, so I was pretty mad at Rowling for some of the things that happened in Book 5, and now I am even more angry with her. It\\'s a good book though. Captivating, wonderfully written. Rowling is an expert storyteller, and the mystery of her books keeps them engaging and good no matter what happens within them. I am upset about the way the story is going though., This is probably the best & at the same time saddest book in the series., reread, Good enough installment. Voldemort\\'s backstory was interesting, the ending left me wanting to read the final Potter book., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Dumbledore\\'s death was very obvious with the amount of time Rowling took in this book to humanize him. Though Snape being the Half-Blood Prince was a surprise; I thought it would be Voldemort even though I thought it odd that he would proudly call himself a half-blood., Wow.... Great book :) and as always; the book is better than the movie., Just a few (tiny amount real, but exceptionally off-putting) punctuation errors that really threw me off and I had to sit there re-reading until my mind made sense of it. \\n Maybe it\\'s my brain instead of the writing. *shrugs*, best book she had done, \"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\", Best of the HP books so far. It just convinced me that every character in the book is real. I was truly impressed. Reading book 6 made series more than fiction for me., hands down my favorite openings of the harry potter books (thus far). minister of magic meets prime minister? cute, informative. followed by the chapter with snape and bellatrix and whatsherface? is snape good? is he evil? is he lying, or telling the truth? what\\'s the deal? it\\'s fucking awesome, is what it is! \\n then there were a whole bunch of chapters in the middle where stuff was happening that i didn\\'t care about. \\n and then harry is whisked off to a cave with dumbledore and crazy stuff is happening and we\\'re back to awesoooooome! \\n if the middle of this book wasn\\'t a snoozefest i would\\'ve been so much more pleased. oh well., Probably my second favorite in the series. \\n #classroomlibrary, *WARNING* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS BUT TRIED TO BE AS SHORT AND VAGUE AS POSSIBLE* \\n Once again J.K. Rowling rips our heart out and hands it to us as Harry must face another shocking death. This book is tough. Harry is just going through the loss of Sirius and it hits him hard. By now there is no question that while Harry is only 16, he is no longer a child by any other means. As The Chosen One, the weight of the world rests heavily on his shoulders. Thankfully he has a few that will help carry his burden. With the exception of Sirius of course, the \\'old gang\\' is all present. The members of the Order and Harry\\'s friends. \\n Like always, there are many challenges that Harry must overcome and the outcome of a few of them will surprise you. It\\'s an excellent book with very serious undertone. I recommend it to everyone., I find it difficult to give a critical review on a series of books that is so ingrained into my young life that if I had not read these books, I would honestly not be who I am today. I have read this book 5-7 times now and it will be a book I go back to again and again over the years of my life. I will always love Harry and his friends., :*-(, This is a great book in the series. Really starts tying everything together!, Best book in potter series.The darkest of all seven books in the series., While this book was so sad it made me cry, I think this was my favorite book of the series. I would have been really pissed off if I didn\\'t know how this series ended., I love all the Harry Potter books., Para ser bem sincero, nem acredito que cheguei ate aqui lendo em ingles nao que para mim seja algo dificil para mim,porem, nao deixa de ser um desafio, uma meta a qual me propus la em julho de 2014 e o fato de saber que estar perto do \"fim\" que ja nao e mais o\"fim pois, agora sao 8 livros MUITO OBRIGADO ! Tia Rowling <3 \\n E falando especialmente desse livro ha duas cenas bem nas paginas finais que fizeram a minha cabeca fervilhar a cena da enfermaria na qual em que Tonks diz a Lupin que o AMA independente da sua condicao de lobisomem e o AMOR de Fleur por Gui apesar de recem infectado por Grayback e a Rowling dizendo que quando se AMA verdadeiramente nao ha obstaculos. \\n A fidelidade de Rony e Hermione para com o Harry e algo que so veio a confirmar aquilo que ja sabia: \\n OVERDADEIRO AMIGO E AQUELE QUE CONTINUA DO SEU LADO QUANDO VOCE ACHA QUE ESTAVA SEM CHAO., Tension - Rowling does tension well. Every major move - the pompous potions teacher, regular meetings with Dumbledore, Harry\\'s new textbook, a handful of romances, Malfoy\\'s unusual behaviors - drew me in and primed me for fallout. \\n I admit that I didn\\'t care much about what Malfoy was doing; his hand in evil seems inevitable, and Harry seems over-interested. Still, with very little intense action throughout, the book pages kept turning, propelling me forward., Loved this book. Best of all so far. Got so wrapped up in it at the end, I forgot to pick my son up from a party and that had never happened in thirteen years. By now the characters are well-drawn and -loved. Relationships are developing, although I personally find the young romantic pairings to be a little trite and unnecessary., LeAdo por primera vez de 07 al 12 de Enero de 2014 \\n Re-leAdo el 19-07-2015 \\n Re-leAdo del 08 al 10 de agosto de 2016 \\n Re-leAdo el 03-07-2016, I\\'m starting to see why these books have such a fanatical following, once you get rolling you can\\'t stop reading them, since I read the fourth one I haven\\'t read any other authors in between because I wanted to finish the series so badly., This was such a great book. My only complaint: too short. I can\\'t wait for the seventh one...but then again, I don\\'t want it all to end!, There\\'s more to people than meets the eye, even enemies have hopes and dreams., I am reviewing the young adult fantasy novel Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince by JK Rowling which is the best teen fiction book I have ever read. This book is around 600 pages so is quite long for a children\\'s book untypically for this genre a major character dies in it. The plot is Harry finds a exercise book by someone called the Half-Blood Prince which contains many formulas and spells etc that get Harry out of many a scrape especially his school work. Malfoy they spy on with an invisible cloak and catch him going in a black witchcraft shop and buying something which he has delivered but they don\\'t know what it is. Later they hear of a story of an old lady who got murdered and her magic locket and necklace were missing which they assume is what Malfoy was buying. The wizardry is on an alert to prevent these artifacts being brought in. Harry is protected by his birthmark so Voldemort can\\'t kill him but Snape and Malfoy are set to help him kill someone else. Harry uses the invisibility cloak to spy on Snape and Malfoy hatching a plan but only catches part of it. It turns out by the way the exercise was planted to help Harry. Dumbledore takes an interest in and tries to mentor Harry. This is the 6th installment in the Harry Potter series and my favorite. I did obviously thoroughly enjoy this book and it is a classic., This was my favorite book tied with book 3! I love harry and Snape. \\n update: \\n After reading this book again for the 4th time I love it even more than the last time.... I forgot about some of the events in this book so it was nice to re-read it....I thought I would brush up on it right before the movie came out.... I\\'m super excited and can\\'t wait to see it in 3D!, *Reread on audio book.* Probably my favorite in the series! It\\'s most likely because I\\'m Ron/Hermione trash., I raced to finish this book before the last one came out so that I could hurry up and read that before it was spoiled by friends, family, and Internet. This book went surprising fast and there was quite a bit of action to consume. I was on the edge of my seat more than with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and there were many questions that I had at the end of it. Far more than I thought Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows could answer. \\n It is definitely one of my favorites from the series and I recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed the books., Not sure how many times I\\'ve read this book but I\\'ve just been sat silently crying for the whole of the last chapter. Totally breaks my heart., It is a bad idea to read the last part of this book when you\\'re feeling down. Like, seriously, it is a very bad idea, even if you know what\\'s gonna happen., ** spoiler alert ** \\n While Prisoner of Azkaban will always be my favorite, I found myself enjoying the sixth book more than I usually do. In fact, it is a close second for me now. \\n In he fifth book Harry is SO angsty (understandable, he has, like a horrible teacher and the whole world pressing against him and he is a TEENAGER). But, in this book he has turned into a snarky and witty teenager, capable of foreseeing some dangers. Yes, his obsession withMalfoy sometimes gets old, but overall I was audibly giggling at his comments. \\n I\\'ve never really been opposed to Ginny & Harry\\'s relationship, but in this read through I was a total fan girl of it. Ginny is a talented and, from what we read, gorgeous boss babe, who has lived through possession and has quite some punch with her magic. It really seemed to make sense to have Ginny & Harry together... And I used to actually kind of get sick of the crushes, and \"Won-won\" moments in this book, but it actually made the characters real. The idea that there could be a completely hidden to muggles parallel realm actually becomes more believable with these teenage drama problems. \\n Lastly, having the knowledge of Snape\\'s true character really let me pick up on how he HELPS Harry throughout the entire time at Hogwarts. \\n I\\'m glad that I have returned, yet again, to the world of HP and look forward to the many rereads in the future. \\n Oh! Also, totally teared up again at death of Dumbledore, but mostly when Fauxes was singing. I dunno, it was a very visual passage for me. \\n Okay: this is officially the longest review I have ever written., I read this thing non-stop until I finished it., So this is definitely my second favorite book in the series. You can just feel the imminent threat of Voldemort and there is a constant shadow that is cast over this book. I can\\'t really tell if it is because I know what is going to happen, but diving back into this book is like when you sit down on a roller coaster. You know you are about to strap in for this incredible ride (the last two books of this series are simply amazing), and by the time you start, you know that there is no turning back. I also love the copious amounts of time that we get with Dumbledore., I was happy with this one, mainly because Harry finally has opened his eyes to a certain girl., Coming back to this book after many years and having only read it once and then seen the movie a few umpteen times, there were lots of parts I had forgotten about. It was nice to revisit these and get a better appreciation for the vision JKR had for her larger story. \\n I never stop marvelling at JKR\\'s mastery of the word!, Some one much beloved dies and it made me cry for about an hour so I gave it four stars but it really deserves 5 1/2 because it begins the process of the end and letting us see what could/might/will happen to these beloved people, A lot of filler with a killer ending, Half-Blood Prince is a perfectly okay instalment in the Harry Potter series. In the wake of the villainous Lord Voldemort\\'s return to power, 16 year-old Harry returns to wizard school, studies Voldemort\\'s past, suspects a peer of plotting evil, and engages in the usual amount of magical shenanigans. This is the first book where Voldemort\\'s evil intentions are out in the open, the wizarding community is actively bracing for war, and Harry understands his role as the only one capable of defeating Voldemort. Though Harry story is still confined to his boarding school, in this book we finally get a sense of what is really at stake in the battle against Voldemort. \\n Half-Blood Prince includes a decent amount of school magic fun and plenty of humorous teen romance, though the book doesn\\'t exactly have a driving, complex plot. Apart from a couple of isolated, ineffective attacks, there isn\\'t much menace behind the antagonist\\'s plot. Most of the tension comes from the characters hearing about a growing stream of deaths and disappearances via the newspaper. Even the Half-Blood Prince plot (which ought to be of vital importance, considering that it is in the title) turns out to be not all that relevant to the overall story. Nonetheless, it\\'s enjoyable when Harry deviously succeeds in Potions class by following the Half-Blood Prince\\'s handwritten instructions in an old textbook, and disturbing when the Prince entices Harry into using a dark curse. Another of my favourite sequences is when Harry uses a luck potion to convince one of his professors to divulge a shameful memory. \\n However, like all the longer Harry Potter books there\\'s a fair amount of padding. Some of the padding comes from needless repetitions. For example, Harry notices his arch rival Draco Malfoy acting suspiciously in a Darks Arts shop and theorises Draco has become initiated as one of Voldemort\\'s followers. He relays his suspicions to everyone who will listen in many separate scenes - though no one believes him. These repetitive discussions add nothing new to Harry\\'s theory, they aren\\'t plot progression, they\\'re redundant. The same thing happens when Harry suspects his teacher Professor Snape of aiding Draco - Harry once again repeats his suspicions to multiple people in separate scenes, convinces no one and generally just wastes his (and the reader\\'s) time. Harry\\'s prolonged investigation into Draco Malfoy\\'s activities is composed of endless, failed attempts that make Harry look incredibly incompetent. In the earlier books Harry was quite clever and capable, but he seems to get progressively more inept with each book. His ineptitude successfully stretches out the weak central plot to the required length, but at the expense of transforming the main character into a total ignoramus. \\n Another source of padding involves the usual assortment of subplots which vary immensely in how interesting they are. I personally found the Quidditch subplot to be tiresome and honestly wish J.K. Rowling had retired the sport a couple of books ago. Rowling does her best to make it fresh and different, but never fully succeeds. Your mileage will vary, but I was equally underwhelmed by subplots like Tonk\\'s deflated mood and Professor Snape\\'s transfer out of the Potions classroom. \\n Some padding comes from Rowling surrounding interesting moments with too much extraneous filler. For example, when Dumbledore first takes Harry into a memory to study Voldemort\\'s past, we spend several pages following the completely random character Bob Ogden before getting to the point. Actually, we don\\'t ever really get to the point because although the mildly interesting memory shows Voldemort\\'s family in an unexpected light, it doesn\\'t exactly contain any super-crucial information. Dumbledore could easily convey his theory about Voldemort much more succinctly instead of drawing it out all year via lengthy trips down memory lane. \\n Having written all this, the final chapters of this book work wonderfully as fantasy spectacle and action scene. The final confrontation also advances the series\\' overall conflict and changes everything going into the final instalment. So it\\'s all incredibly frustrating when Harry and Dumbledore\\'s efforts are revealed to have been for nothing. At the end of the day, I think Half-Blood Prince is moderately enjoyable, but unfortunately overlong, repetitive and ultimately futile., I\\'m a huge fan of Harry Potter, this one is probably the best of the series. There is so much more to this series than a kids story about wizards...you learn about life, love, friends, all that good stuff!, can\\'t wait to get onto the next one, This is a great series. It\\'s one that I (like everyone else) fell in love with. I will admit there are all sorts of problems with plot holes, limited character development, and the like, but this world is enchanting and captivating. It sucks you in and you find you don\\'t care about all those details., Harry suspects that Malfoy has become a Deatheater and tries to warn everybody but Dumbledore, Hermione, and Ron don\\'t believe him. Meanwhile, Dumbledore is giving Harry lessons about Tom Riddle and someone is trying to kill someone else and Harry suspects Malfoy is the one trying to kill., Me ha roto el corazon en mil pedazos, he berreado como nunca y me he reido con Ron y Lavender y Hermione y Harry y Ginny y y y y... Creo que tengo que esperar un poco para leer el septimo o tendre una grave depresion (ahora sufro una post-HP6). Simplemente, increible. \\n {Relectura en ingles} (20/09/15) Sigo sin poder expresar en palabras como me llega Harry Potter con cada palabra, aun siendo la segunda vez que los leo y haciendolo en ingles, no me duran mas de dos dias y no hay libro con el que no me ria o no llore con ellos. Simplemente increible., Yes yes, I went in the wrong order and watched all of the movies years before ever picking up the books. But I must say, while I LOVE the movies, this was always my LEAST favorite. Now that I have been reading the books, I\\'ve been looking forward to this one with high hopes, hoping that it would connect dots, and help me make sense of the movie. Hoping this book would be just as good as the others, and not disappoint (much like the movie had for me.) I did really enjoy the book, so yey! Now I can\\'t wait to watch the movie again, and hopefully enjoy it more than I have in the past! Not my favorite of the books, but I did really enjoy it! Can\\'t believe I only have one left to read :(, Not really sure why, but I particularly adore this HP book, I had a slow start with this book because I went on vacation and couldn\\'t take it with me. \\n I think so far this has been the saddest book for me but at the same time it\\'s incredibly revealing. \\n Now I can\\'t wait to read the last one., poteriada iqop`a 2 nacilad. \\n \"modi davcer sabavshvo cigns da vnaxot`, rac` ik`neba\" \\n es nacili vrc`eldeba 3 1/2 cignze. \\n azkabanis tqve aris gardamavali elementi nacilshi, romelsac` ecodeba \\n \"bavshvebi ukve gaizardnen\" \\n pirvel nacilshi sauket`eso cignia sulsul pirveli - p`ilosop`iuri k`va. ramet`u qvelaze kargad akmaqop`ilebs sabavshvo nacilis mot`xovnilebebs. \\n Half-Blood Prince aris jer-jerobit` sauket`eso cigni (pirveli 6 cignis manz\\'ilze) meore nacilshi. \\n vot., Wow. \\n I spent my time listening to the audiobook version of this and honestly I don\\'t as much enjoyment out of books via audiobooks for some reason and the same goes for this, I just find my mind wondering for too long and it gets annoying. Also I can read faster than Stephen Fry can talk so it makes it a better reading experience idk why it does, it just does. \\n However, I did read the last chapter instead of listening to the audiobook and cried the entire time. Holy shit., I was a sobbing mess at the end of this one. Stop looking at reviews and read this series. Seriously, what are you still doing here? Read it!, Unlike earlier books in the series, which I\\'ve re-read many times (I used to re-read them while waiting for the later books to come out), this was the first time I\\'d revisited Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince since I finished the series. It\\'s a very different experience, reading this book now that I know how the whole epic conflict with Voldemort works out, than my relatively-unspoiled first reading. (At the time, there were rumors that a major character died; I had my theories but scrupulously avoided any media where spoilers might lurk, and I read the whole book in two days on the day of release, so I got to enjoy, er, experience the surprise.) \\n This second time through, knowing what\\'s coming, it strikes me that Book Six is actually very bittersweet. Half-Blood Prince isn\\'t as dark and brooding as the preceding book, Order of the Phoenix. Now that Dolores Umbridge is gone, Hogwarts is a bright, happy place again. Now that the O.W.Ls (standardized testing for wizard students) is behind them, Harry and his friends seem to enjoy their classes more; they are less pressured, more leisurely. They find time for romance, for quidditch, for weekends in Hogsmeade, for learning how to apparate. Harry, who was furious at being ignored by Dumbledore in Order of the Phoenix, is back on good terms with the headmaster again: he\\'s even singled out for special one-on-one lessons aimed to help him defeat Voldemort when the time comes. \\n Book Six is the calm before the storm. \\n Outside of Hogwarts, terrible things are happening now that Voldemort is back -- the Daily Prophet is always full of stories of kidnappings, murders, and other tragedies that show the Dark Lord is gaining ground -- and Harry and the others are aware of these miseries but insulated from them. In these dark times more than every before, Hogwarts is a haven, a refuge, a bubble. Dumbledore is the only wizard Voldemort fears, and so Dumbledore\\'s school is the safest place to be. \\n Knowing now that this is Harry\\'s last year at Hogwarts (rather than the anticipated 7th year), I think it\\'s kind of lovely that it was generally such a nice one: that he got to be the Quidditch team captain, that he finally had a potions teacher he could stand, that Gryffindor won the Quidditch cup, and Harry and Ginny got to enjoy a few weeks of happiness. \\n Of course that idyllic calm can\\'t last, and the conclusion is meant to set up the final book, Deathly Hallows. While it\\'s not a cliffhanger in the traditional sense, the end of Half-Blood Prince leaves a lot more open questions than the relatively self-contained plot of the other books in the series. Again, knowing what is coming changed my perspective on the ending. The first time I read it, I was stunned and horrified, \\n not only by Dumbledore\\'s death but also by Snape\\'s apparent betrayal, \\n but this time, I approached the final chapters with a strong sense of inevitability. \\n Random Spoilery Thought: \\n As I\\'ve been making my way through Litchick\\'s Epic Harry Potter Group Read (which has now been going on since before Thanksgiving), I\\'ve been thinking all along that Snape is so horrible, more horrible than I remembered, so horrible that the big reveal at the end of Deathly Hallows falls flat because it isn\\'t enough to redeem such a nasty character. I still kind of feel that way, but in retrospect I think the part of Half-Blood Prince where Snape gives Harry Saturday detentions after Harry and Malfoy duel is a bit of a give-away. Detention is a really lenient punishment for almost murdering someone, and I should have been much more suspicious of that at the time., If you haven\\'t read this book, don\\'t even attempt to read this review. Honestly, you\\'re just going to regret doing so. \\n It\\'s been two years since I read this for the first time. Yes, two years separated tte moment in which I finished book 5 and started book 6. Now, don\\'t ask me why because I don\\'t know. \\n This is a book I particularly like. Well, duh, I like all the HP books, but I mean this is one of my favourite HP books. The reasons are plenty, so I will mention only one: Tom Riddle, or as we knew him from the beginning of this series, Lord Voldemort. \\n From the moment I knew he was Harry\\'s enemy and the one who murdered his parents, a certain curiosity to know why he had done that and to know more about his past was born, yet we didn\\'t fully understand him till this book, in which he was finally given a backstory. \\n And what a backstory it was. One would be even more afraid of him after getting to know bits of his past, and indeed, I was, but I was more intrigued by his character than afraid of him. \\n As for the... death in this book (you know which one I\\'m talking about)... I don\\'t know if it\\'s the same for you as it is with me, but I found it more shocking than sad. I think that\\'s because of all the things happeing around. There were so many surprises revealed, and the book only got more and more intense. \\n But of course, Dumbledore isn\\'t really gone if there are still loyal people to him, isn\\'t that true? What I sure will miss are his words of wisdom, some of which I carry with me as if they were a treasure, like this one I took from this book: \\n It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. \\n And with reason I did. I mean, how true is that? \\n Now I will reread the last book. I know what expects me is lots of darkness, death, and even more surprised than the ones revealed previously in the series. I am not prepared, but I will continue as Harry did with the task of the Horcruxes., Still good :), Bought for Myself \\n Overall Rating: 5.00 + \\n Series Rating: 5.00 + \\n NOTE: June 26, 2011 marks my \"Gosh I don\\'t know how many times I have read this book\" annual Re-Read! I will be changing all my ratings of this series to 5 because I have come to the conclusion that if I can re-read them this many times they are worthy of a 5! \\n What I Loved: This book I think is the one Harry finally starts to grow up a little though he is still way to angry for my taste. It has been a long time since I was 16 so maybe that is normal with all the loss that he has had in his life. I loved how they kind of split up the team for a bit so they could understand how important they were to each other. Also, I like the blossoming of young love that happened in this book because if you aren\\'t fighting for love and hope then what is the point. Loved the Weasley twins as always! They are the right amount of lightness that is needed in dark times! \\n Just my thoughts: This isn\\'t my favorite book in the series--never has been. To be honest, there are times when I think Malfoy is growing up more than Harry. I don\\'t like Malfoy but his journey has kind of been the flip side of Harry\\'s all along. Ron and Hermoine again to me are the best friends anyone can have. They put up with so much from Harry and until the very last of the book I don\\'t think he realizes how lucky he really is. \\n Why I gave it a 5+: After re-reading this book so many times, I have decided that all the growing pains were necessary to lead up to the last book in the series. The stuff I didn\\'t like had to do mostly with Harry---his anger, especially after the last book, really kind of didn\\'t work for me. Also, don\\'t like how he constantly questions Dumbledors thoughts on Snape. Still a really great book though. \\n What I read/listened to this time around (I usually do a listen/read combo--sometimes not): \\n 2009: HC US \\n 2010: HC US \\n 2011: HC US/Audiobook US \\n 2012: HC US/Audiobook US \\n 2013: Ebook US/Audiobook US 07/16/2013 \\n 2014: Ebook US/Audiobook UK Jun 27, 2014 \\n 2015: Ebook UK \\n 2016: Ebook UK/Hardcover UK/Audiobook UK \\n 2017: Ebook UK/Audibook UK, Best of the second half of the series., refreshing my memory so i\\'m fully ready for the twisty, turny seventh book. this is my third time through, actually. first time: day after chris\\' corner\\'s midnight release party, for which i was drawing lightning bolts on kids\\' foreheads. i read it frantically so that no kids would tell me the ending before i got to it on my own. second time was listening to jim dale\\'s amazing performance on tape. hooray for him!, gw sedih banget prof.dumbledornya mati hiks, This book won\\'t teach you anything or make you think, but it\\'s thoroughly enjoyable. It\\'s a fast, fun read. I especially like this book for the Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny relationships., Great read!, Wow - I reported in my review of Order of the Phoenix that it was the longest Harry Potter book by page count, but Half-Blood Prince is only two pages shorter. Considering that each of my reviews takes the page count of the book that I\\'m reviewing and turns it into a word count for the article, I have my work cut out for me. \\n I didn\\'t think much of Half-Blood Prince, which is why I only gave it a 7/10 - it was professional and proficient, but it just wasn\\'t as magical as the other books in the series. Oh, sure - it was necessary. If anything, the story line itself is developed just as much (if not more) in this book than it is anywhere else. It\\'s just that it doesn\\'t feel like much fun whist it\\'s all happening, and a high-profile character gets killed off, too. \\n Broadly speaking, the plot introduces the concept of horcruxes, which are fragments of Lord Voldemort\\'s soul which were introduced to a number of different objects to preserve the Dark Lord\\'s immortality. One such horcrux was Tom Riddle\\'s diary, which you might remember from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I\\'m not going to spoil it by telling you what each of those horcruxes are, but I will tell you that in this book, Harry learns that it falls to him to hunt them down and to destroy them. \\n This is largely what happens in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, which was much more exciting. In contrast, the vast majority of this book seems like it\\'s only present to set the scene for the final book in the series. That said, it is interesting to watch as the wizarding world is forced to deal with the return of the Death Eaters, and the slow descent into fear which characterises the return to power of He Who Must Not Be Named. There\\'s a darker feel throughout it, and it feels like Rowing\\'s universe has finally matured, like it\\'s grown from a child to an adult. \\n Now, I\\'m not saying that you shouldn\\'t read this book - I\\'m just saying that it\\'s something of a let down, if you compare it to the rest of the books in the series. It just didn\\'t seem to have the same magic - it was a bit like reading a Rick Riordan book instead of a J. K. Rowling book. Competent enough, but somehow missing that secret ingredient. You should still read Half-Blood Prince, if only to discover who the titular character is, but you should read each of the books in order. That way, you\\'ll be so deeply invested in the series that by the time that you get here, you\\'ll be determined to see it through. \\n I don\\'t mean to be too harsh on Half-Blood Prince, because there\\'s nothing inherently wrong with it - indeed, I\\'m sure there are fans out there who regard it as their favourite book in the series - but I will say that it just didn\\'t do it for me. That\\'s all I have to say on the matter, really - it didn\\'t feel right, it didn\\'t hit home, and I just didn\\'t think much of it either whilst I was reading it or afterwards. \\n Unfortunately, I still have another 200 words to fill, so let\\'s take a look at its reception. It\\'s certainly true that it broke a lot of records, although many of those same records were eventually beaten by its successor, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and it also sold a lot of copies. My counterargument to that would be that Rowling could have released anything and she still would\\'ve received the same reception - and, like I said, there\\'s nothing that\\'s actually wrong with it. \\n Perhaps part of my attitude towards it stems from its release date - I was about sixteen at the time, and so I had a lot of other things on my mind. But I still read it pretty quickly, and I\\'d had high hopes for it after The Order of the Phoenix, which was one of my favourites. It just didn\\'t live up to my expectations, and that\\'s a shame - other than Harry Potter and the Philosopher\\'s Stone, which is much more of a \\'children\\'s book\\', no other book in the series left such a lasting impression of mediocrity. But hey ho - not to worry about it, just read your way through it and then move on to Deathly Hallows!, This was my least favorite Harry Potter book. I mean, it was nice (I\\'ve read it over 100 times). But it was a little too mushy for me. I was only in 5th grade then, and I did not have as much tolerance for that sort of stuff as I do now. :), was ok, I just re-read this and loved it again. I read the Bloomsbury edition this time and found a few little difference. It made it even more fun. These books are timeless., Great prelude to book 7 - rowling definitely knows how to intertwine her other books!, This was not one of my favorites in the series however I still enojyed it and it really leads you up to the last book., Love it! 4.5*, Excellent book! Much better than the movie, although I did enjoy that, as well. I already started on the next book., Best of the Harry Potter series!, This is my FAVORITE from the entire series! I love it!, I liked this book, I thought the story line involving the half blood prince was interesting, and the last few chapters are impossible to put down. I did think, however, that there was too much emphasis on \"snogging\", I was surprised that Dumbledore let Snape be the DADA teacher then again Dumbledore trusts Snape even thought Snape hates Harry because he reminds Snape of what his father did to him when they were at Hogwarts. It was interesting to see the other side of Snape since Harry learned a lot from him even though he did not know it. \\n I was disappointed to see Malfoy\\'s character fall. In the beginning he was a great bully but when he has to prove himself to become a death eater he becomes this wimpy girl afraid of Voldemort. He would have turned into a great death eater if he had more courage and stood up to Voldemort. He should have took Wormtail\\'s place as his servant. Now that would be character development., i enjoyed reading this book. i was thrilled all throughout the book., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I have just finished frantically devouring the most recent installment of my favorite fantasy series, and I\\'m left, for the most part, disappointed. Perhaps I did not get enough sleep while reading this book, or perhaps I read it too quickly or anticipated it too much. For whatever reason, I can\\'t help but feel that this book distinctly lacked the \"magic touch\" that many critics and fans feel have infused J.K. Rowling\\'s previous books. \\n I have liked the books more and more as each came out, until I had reached a point of near ecstasy with \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", which I found to be nearly perfect, but in part because of its sprawling length. And then I come to the sixth book, which while still great by the standards of most children\\'s literature, completely loses the momentum generated by the fifth book. It feels overly short, and yet does not seem to have the same manic energy driving it forward that all the other books had. I spent much of the middle of the book wondering what the point of it all, unable to pick up the thread of the plot and sensing that the mystery and complexity of the twist and turns of the previous books was not present. Though by all rights the wizarding world should be at its scariest ever, the book lacks the sense of foreboding and darkness that was so strongly present in the fifth. That sense of dread seems to have been forgotten in favor of a rash of silly and, quite frankly, annoying love connections being made throughout Hogwarts. Now don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m just as big a \"shipper\" as the next female Harry Potter fan, but the relationships that finally crop up in this book seem hollow and forced. Ron and Lavender\\'s dating stint is completely uncalled for and really makes no sense, but even the more serious relationships seemed stiff and didn\\'t excite me at all. \\n The standard new teacher, Slughorn, seems uninspired and unnecessary, and I wondered much of the book why he was even there, other than to be the new teacher needed every year to fill the vacancy left by the departing Defense of the Dark Arts teacher. Speaking of pointless, the whole Half Blood Prince subplot really didn\\'t seem to fit in anywhere, and I\\'m curious as to why it was put in at all, other than to be an alias used to put a well known character in the title without tipping off the reader. Unless Slughorn and the \"Prince\" plot lines pick up in the seventh book, they will have been pretty much nothing but plot devices. \\n The book only seems to come alive in the scenes that deal with the bad guys. We see lots of new material on Voldemort which is interesting and important. Draco and Snape are immensely important to the plot, and I found myself, for the first time ever, wondering much more what was going through their heads rather than through the heads of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Both have come into their own, as intriguing characters poised precariously on the boundary between good and evil, and I am thrilled to see what becomes of them in the end. \\n The book really does get good at the end, with some good old fashioned Harry Potter fighting, excitement and tragedy. The last 100 pages are pretty good, and make some progress towards making up for the rest of the book. The end sets the stage excellently for the seventh book, and made me very eager for it, as it sounds like Harry\\'s life will change dramatically in the future. \\n In all, the book feels like a bit of a waste, since not much happens in terms of plot and most of the book is spent on developing character relationships, which would be fine if the characters didn\\'t seem so oddly stiff and out of character. I felt an annoyance with it and detachment from the main characters that I have never felt before. The energy of Sirius, Fred and George is sorely missed, let me tell you. In the end, I almost felt like Draco and Snape are my two new favorite characters, since they were by far the most psychologically interesting in this installment. Still, it ended on a very high note, and I will certainly be picking up the seventh as soon as I can, hoping to see everything wrap up like clockwork the way that J.K. Rowling has always planned., Actual rating: 4.5, The entire Harry Potter series reminds me of my childood. As a kid I inhaled fantasy novels and these bring it all back. \\n I think J.K Rowlings books are quite well written and I like how she combines a fantasy novel with, what I consider to be, a teen novel of sorts, about friendship and growing up., Damn, Harry Potter is getting darker and has more romance in each book progressively... This one\\'s kinda creepy though and saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad, cause spoilers ;), I read this last year and don\\'t remember it but I know it will all come back to me when I read the last book of the series, soon, which I am anxious to do! I enjoyed the Harry Potter series very much., Reading this book for a second time I still couldn\\'t put it down. Thoroughly enjoyed every minute reading this book!, A war between the Death eaters and, the rest of the wizarding world, in Brittan only, yet this is a shocking read towards the end. Love is also in the air at Hogwarts between two certain people. Well, more than that really, but you know what I mean. Again, thank you J.K.R, 4.5. Posiblemente mi libro favorito de la saga hasta ahora, me gusto muchisimo y me atrapo en muchos sentidos., Reread June 2015 \\n Reread February 2016, Voldemort\\'s story and answers to every single one of the million questions swarming the minds of every HP fan. Awesome., 3rd time is a charm., Read it 5 times and still would read it for another hundred times! This book gets more interesting everytime I read it. I grew up with it and let me just say that I\\'m pretty sure even my grand-grand children will grow with it. It\\'s not for kids, or for grown-ups it\\'s for persons who can find the magic in themselves. A must-read!, This wee pickle was one of my favourites yet! I won\\'t offer a synopsis as you either already know and love the story dearly or you certainly won\\'t be wanting me to spoil the books for you if you\\'ve yet to make the worthy pilgrimage. Basically, just read it!, Not as good as book 5. \\n I have also the book in german., When escapism and light relief are needed, she fairly does the job., I didn\\'t much care for this one most of the way through. Thought it had a really slow start. Now, I see that\\'s because it\\'s a definite precursor for the last one. First of the HP books to end on a cliffhanger. \\n The last 250 pages or so were spectacular. Kept me up reading until 4:30 in the morning. Positively brilliant stuff., The end of this book always gets me. Right in the feels. I remember finishing it and wondering how in the heck I was going to wait until the next one came out--luckily I no longer have that problem. Let the HP binge continue!, Love, Love, Love!, Description TBT, Amazingly sad. Cried like a baby, Why, oh why?? \\n I can\\'t stop crying! \\n I should give this book one star because of my broken heart., This is by far my favorite Harry Potter book. The whole series is phenomenal, OBVIOUSLY, but this book was my absolute favorite to read. I\\'m looking forward to rereading it honestly!, Every time I go back to read books in the Harry Potter series, I always dread this book. Although it is just as brilliantly written as all of the others, this one becomes so much more dark. It is a soul sucker. \\n The magic is gone. Harry means business., I really enjoyed this one! The ending TOTALLY caught me off guard., I bought this book about a year ago. I started reading it, but I guess I wasn\\'t in the mood for it. So, I set it aside. I picked it back up again a couple of weeks ago and I\\'m loving it! Just like I knew I would! And just like I loved the first five books in the series. I even have my mom reading them. I bought her the spanish versions and she just loves them...LOL, Dumbledore... Please come back... *cries*, Not my favorite of the series but still awesome :), What a great book this is! This book seems different in my opinion because the characters deal with romance, harder classes, and just growing up in general. And then of course there is the search for the defeat of Lord Voldemort! I couldn\\'t put this book down, and couldn\\'t believe the ending!, These books just keep on getting better and better. I\\'m extremely excited to read the seventh once I finish up some other books I\\'m reading. Neville and Luna ROCK!!!!,, It was heartbreaking and thrilling at the same time.., Mi libro favorito de la saga Harry Potter. Es divertido, ligero, lleno de romance y sus problematicas (no solo entre los adolescentes [Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione] sino tambien entre los adultos [Bill/Fleur, Remus/Tonks]). A comparacion del ultimo, este no es nada oscuro, hasta el final. Aparte de que Harry empieza a conocer mas sobre su mision final y Draco tambien tiene que decidir su destino, emprendiendo un camino peligroso. Las peliculas jamas le haran justicia a los libros, pero en este caso en particular, la pelicula dejo mucho que desear., Awesome book with Draco Malfoy, Voldemort, Tom Riddle, Professor Snape - true Slytherin action, Another exciting, and this time strangely emotionally compelling, adventure-fraught year for Harry and friends., I love Harry Potter and this book is one of The best. Harry finally Takes a step against The last battle and many questions are starting to get their answers., 2017 update: \\n adult\\'s point of view - this series is too dark and sad for a kids section. it\\'s disturbing. \\n // SPOILER \\n I didn\\'t cried when Mufasa died, though I sobbed like a baby on Dumbledore\\'s funeral., ** spoiler alert ** \\n The death of Dumbledore was pretty much obvious. Nevertheless, his death and funeral were still the most heartbreaking scenes!, I enjoyed that there was less angst, and this was my first read-through where I think I enjoyed Ginny (or at least appreciated her)., I\\'m re-reading this before I see the movie. It was as good as I remembered so I re-read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows., \"Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right\" \\n XD, 9/10 \\n What can I say? Yes another great book by JK Rowling! This is the book where things become \"real\" and dangerous. Love develops in several places, heart wrenching scenes are met and the path is lain for the final book. \\n I got a bit frustrated that nobody listened to Harry and kept saying he was overreacting! \\n And then there was when Fleur said she is pretty enough for both of them, she won me and not just Mrs. Weasley over :) \\n Voldemort\\'s back story was also very interesting and a lot of things were explained in this book. This instalment was undoubtedly sad and packed full of emotions and a great example of why I love Harry Potter so much! \\n *****Spoilers***** \\n When I first read the book I knew Dumbledore was going to die, but I still did not believe it when it happened. I still have this hope that he will come back, that he is still alive... :( \\n Oh and Snape, even though I know, I just can\\'t help but hate you in this book!, Good read, So SHOCKING!!, Good. Let\\'s just bring Dumbeldore back though, and then I\\'ll give it five stars., My favorite book among the Harry Potter Series (I think). I was VERY surprised when I read it the first time. Never imagined Harry ending up with Ginny. But it\\'s an amazing book overall., Just finished it about 4 days. It was just what I needed gripping! But I was sad with what happened!, I love everything that this book brings to the world and story of Harry Potter. However, I agree with other reviewers that this one isn\\'t at all the best written of the series. There really isn\\'t a central plot other than flash backs that help build to the next book and conclusion of the series., Every time I reread this series the things I like and dislike change., This one was hard to put down, Loved it!, Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do., Aaaaaaa!!!! I can wait to begin with the last one!!!!!, This book was great as always. Harry continues to be a little reckless but over all very good. we learn some interesting secrets. sad that Dumbledore died but I have a feeling he\\'s not completely gone because Dumbledore is one of the greatest wizards to man and he would have been prepared., Though, I expect this book to be thicker than its predecessors, I tasted contentment after I read and reread it. \\n The plot remains compelling, the characters are still, and seeemed to be, breathing, and the magic is astounding. I have read a lot of reviews, positive or otherwise. However, whether they slap diatribes about Rowling\\'s writing skills or they praise her like god doesn\\'t seem to affect me in the slightest. I will still declare this book to be a must-have, A1, favorite and the bestest of the best. \\n Though Voldemort rose again to supremacy, J.K. Rowling introduced him as a figment of the past and I would credit her for that, knowing someone\\'s enemy is the best strategy in order to defeat him. This book takes us back how Dumbledore introduced Tom Riddle, an orphan, in the wizarding world until he became what he is, immortal and wicked. \\n The death of a very clever person is a moving revelation and the Half-Blood\\'s Prince spotlight is also intriguing. Snape was not really a priority during the previous books. However, though, not at large, his character build-up is a strong portion of the novel. Harry\\'s love affair and leadership also bloomed, with his friend\\'s help and bickering. The readers are entertained with love stories from Ron and Hermione, and Ginny and Harry. The audience are filled with thoughts about what Draco Malfoy has on his sleeves. And our eyes are filled with tears because of the death of one of the most beloved character and the greatest wizard of all time. \\n I would not let myself underrate such a creation., Source: I own multiple copies of this book. \\n Cost: Unknown \\n Title: Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince \\n Series: Harry Potter #6 \\n Author: JK Rowling \\n Overall Rating: 5 stars \\n I am not okay. \\n This book genuinely has broken my heart, I can tell where the saddest parts are in my copy as the pages are literally tear stained. Growing up, I read and re-read this whole series multiple times, and I can literally tell you every detail in every book, but every single time, it breaks my heart. I\\'m not okay with this series, especially being slightly sleep deprived as I read this book. \\n I think this book makes you feel kind of okay despite how sad the world around it is, there is an undercurrent of sadness and grimness, but there is also humour and a glimmer of hope and it kind of makes you feel like everything will be okay then WHAM. \\n The thing that shall not be named happens. \\n Which wasn\\'t very nice JK. Thank you., Wow...just wow., I loved book 6! Excelletn set-up to the last books., Another pre-sale book...AMAZING! Another tear-jerker though!! (The movie\\'s not out yet, so I won\\'t spoil it!), word count: 168,923 \\n rating: far better than I remember \\n I\\'ve re-read most of Harry Potter books several times, but the last two... Well, they were much darker and I\\'m squeamish, especially when it comes to things I\\'m so emotionally invested in. So when I picked up the 6th book I wasn\\'t so sure I want to read it at all. \\n Boy, was I wrong. It was good. Very good. Rowling got quite excellent in writing throughout the years. Those logical mistakes we find in the first books are gradually fewer and fewer until we end up with a book that at first sight doesn\\'t bother us at all (yes, if you\\'re mean you can find something to complain about, that\\'s always possible, but that doesn\\'t mean much). \\n About the tone: \\n It\\'s been gradually changing. In the fifth book we get a mix of focus on school and Voldemort with a big, dark \\'umph\\' at the end which tells us all bets are off. In the Half Blood Prince lessons and school stuff we grew to love are clearly secondary; we said good bye to them when Fred and George left the school (at least that\\'s how I feel). Now our characters are still at Hogwarts, but lessons, quidditch games and feasts are barely mentioned in the passing - they\\'re not the point. \\n That shift is very clear. Now Harry is preparing for the grand finale. \\n Is that a good thing? Yes, it\\'s great for the whole story, even if it\\'s less \\'fun\\'. You\\'ve got to understand that I\\'ve read all of it before, so there was no sense of novelty to things Harry finds out. Less stress, but also less excitement. But the first time I read it... it was nerve-racking. \\n Harry is a bit more grown up; he\\'s still prone to some teen behaviours, but far, far less than in the Order of the Phoenix. \\n Characters are developing and getting more and more multidimensional (Dumbledore, Herione, Ron... everyone, even those on the side of evil, like the Malfoys). I love that growing complexity. That things aren\\'t black and white, simple. In LOTR you have orcs, creatures utterly dispensable, there\\'s no gravitas to killing them. It\\'s a no-brainer. In HP we\\'re dealing with people, and people are much more complex. Value of life is much more difficult to estimate. People aren\\'t simply divided into good and bad, there\\'s so much more to the way they choose to act! And Rowling is brilliant in showing it. \\n Actually, Rowling is brilliant. Period. The effortless way in which she conveys thing deserves the highest respect. There\\'s so much \\'showing\\' other authors should freaking study her writing. I didn\\'t notice it at first, it just happens, it took some conscious effort on my side to see it. That\\'s how engrossed you are in the story. \\n I love it. I love the ending, I love reaction of members of the Order of the Phoenix to the news, I love Luna and Neville (Rowling introduces so many different types of people with varying qualities that are worth respect!), I love the Ron-Hermione relationship that starts changing, I love how dangerous using spells you don\\'t really know is, how dangers of magic are presented. I love the teachers, the students, the ministry of magic (cause aren\\'t all the politicians speckled with various stinky, shitty things?), I love how cold and calm becomes Harry\\'s reaction to it... I love a lot of things I\\'m unable to name at this time. \\n Including the action scenes! It would be so easy to fuck up the fights, and yet they are dynamic and exciting. Wow. Just wow. \\n Re-reading that book helped me admire Rowling even more., I am not okay. (Also, WHERE THE HECK IS NEVILLE.) \\n Review of entire series to follow on my blog (once I finish the series, that is)., I\\'ve read this book four times, cover to cover, and it still makes me cry., I enjoyed this even more on the re-read. In some ways it is a break from all the dark stuff, but it still permeates the book. The ending is terribly sad too. I think the invention of Felix Felicis is really great - I love how that all plays out., oooooooh so good - i wanted to re-read this book before the movie came out. i cried and cried and cried at the end. JK rowling is an amazing writer - how DOES she do it?? I love re-reding the Harry Potter books, its like visiting with an old friend., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Good plot and the Voldemort investigation., OK so this book had a lot of information to give. Some may think that is exciting, and some may think it is boring. I thought it was alright because I do need a little action. That is why I only gave it 4 stars. There are some parts that I cannot wait to see in the movie this summer. And since this was a book filled with so much information, I know that a lot of it is also going to be left out. \\n So onto the last book I go..., wow wow wow. what a shocking end to the sixth book. \\n You know that this book is building up to the last book and that it will be full of suspense and tear. \\n I do have to say I cried so bad when Hagrats dog died and dumbledor. its sad to see the characters we love to die. I think this prepares us for the last book where there will be death \\n will for always be a pothead, Obviously one of my favorite series! J. K. Rowling made an excellent job with the development of the story this my least favorite book of the series but it was good, though. The movie was such a mess compared with the book., This series only gets better as you reread it, honestly., And Dumbledore!, LOVED IT, CRIED OVER IT, LAUGHED OVER IT, AND HUGGED IT! THE FEELS HAVE BEEN PRETTY STRONG IN THIS ONE AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WILL HAPPEN (EVEN IF I KNOW SOME SPOILERS) IN THE LAST BOOK- HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS., I gave this book a 4-star rating, because I didn\\'t enjoy it quite as much as its predecessor. Fantastic storyline as usual, but I don\\'t think the whole Harry/Ginny relationship was written as well as it could have been... I think romance writing might be J. K. Rowling\\'s weak spot. \\n All things considering, though, it\\'s Harry Potter! Another really sad ending as well., Best one yet., Rating: 8/10, The darkest of the series. This is a great book in the series!, The sixth in the series....I loved this one too! This book is so imprortant. It gives us much needed information about Voldy. I love the answers it gave me and how it left me with so many more questions!, <3 Just so good, Love this!, Had to read it again to really love it. Very different in structure from 1-5. Still bril., There are a surprising number of things I didn\\'t remember about this book from when I read it 10 years ago... I guess that\\'s not really a surprise, when you think about it like that. I hadn\\'t forgotten events, exactly, but more like how/who/what sort of things. But maybe I repressed the details due to the trauma of the ending..., For the full review (including a reason why Alaina can\\'t listen to U2 sing \"All I Want is You\" without thinking about Dumbledore), follow the link to That\\'s What She Read., My favorite of the series, loved it, Good grief, I knew what to expect and what was to happen. I just didn\\'t expect to take as bad (actually even worse) than when I watched the movie. I need a good long cry, some chocolate, and courage to read the last book. Jk Rowling, what have you done to me?!?!, I first read this when I was a child, and the whole series is a definite 5 for me. I grew up with this. Heck, my parents loved it so much we used to watch the movies together. \\n It just gets darker and darker..., Not enough satisfactory after the previous one., I have really struggled with my feelings for Dumbledore during this re-read of the series. While I liked Dumbledore growing up, I don\\'t think I really thought about his actions all that deeply. I think that he did grow to care for Harry many of his initial actions and even the ones in this book are selfish. Dumbledore wanted to protect Harry from the knowledge of what he must do, but at the same time gave Harry the space to test his mettle against Voldemort several times (without Harry knowing the full consequences). Even in this book he wants to finally tell Harry everything, but he keeps much back and dangles the promise of more knowledge in front of Harry if only Harry will do things for him. Growing up I revered Dumbledore, but now I see him as much more human. I, also, love the theory that Dumbledore is Death--especially because Harry would never be equal to Dumbledore because he often had to the play the game with Dumbledore\\'s rules. However, Harry meets Dumbledore \"as an equal\" on his terms and in his own time in the next book despite questioning D\\'s motives and thinking about quitting. Overall, this book is not my favorite of the books, but I love the history of Voldemort and Slughorn is amusing., Este es mi libro favorito de la saga, porque siento que es el punto en donde la historia da un giro de 180deg y las cosas respecto a Voldemort, Dumbledore, Snape y el mismisimo Harry Potter toman una nueva perspectiva. Me encantan los recuerdos asociados a Tom Ryddle y el final es uno de los mas impactantes que he leido. Releerlo fue todo un placer., Amazing! I really love the development of the relationships between the characters! I had heard spoilers from the book but they still took me by surprise when I read them!, OH HEY LOOK A THING I DID. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH. ONE MORE BOOK TO GOOOOOOOOOOO., And this book is the beginning of the end! What a mystery. Love you Queen Rowling xo, Buku paling \"gelap\\' dari HP series.. \\n hiks. sedih. Kaget pas Dumbledorenya meninggal., I have read the whole series and loved everyone of them. They take you to another world where most anything is possible., I can\\'t even begin to review this book except to say it doesn\\'t matter how much I know, it\\'s always a devastating read. There are always tears., I love how this story just keeps getting darker but there is always that underlying tone of friendship and love and heroism., Awesome...and I think I shed a few tears at the end. Poor Dumbledore., Third time through and I still cried at the end. And enjoyed the whole thing no end (except for the Ron and Hermione arc - but it works for the age group for which it is intended). \\n ======== \\n Although I am pleased that the time with the Dursleys has been cut drastically short in the later books, it seems to have been replaced by Harry\\'s bad-temper at being misunderstood and insistence on investigating problems that no one else agrees is a problem. That is not to say that he might not be right, but the persistence of the bad-temper and \"misunderstood\" attitude puts me distinctly in sympathy with Sirus Black\\'s ancestor\\'s portrait in the last book when he acidly pointed out how those attitudes are common and boring in the young. \\n That aside, I\\'m enjoying this book just as much as the others ... at about chapter 10. As always, I\\'m still amazed at how little I remember of the plot, whether small points or large ... \\n UPDATE \\n Ok, seriously. I\\'m on chapter 26, on the trail of the horucrux with Harry and Dumbledore. How can I NOT remember one thing about this? On the other hand, I can testify that it is a very suspenseful book, well written ... and one I can\\'t stop listening to... \\n FINAL - SPOILERS INCLUDED \\n *sniffle* Ok, I have finished. did remember that Dumbledore died. I did remember that somehow the book ended with all fans violently arguing about whether Snape was good or evil ... and that I adamantly maintained that Dumbledore was asking Snape to kill him, which Snape didn\\'t want to do. I think the reason I tended to forget the end of this book was that I got this battle confused with the bigger battle at the end of The Deathly Hallows. \\n Well only time will tell that, as I have requested the audio version of Deathly Hallows but am waiting in line. The last movie must have made many more people than me revisit the audio versions. \\n What a wonderful, satisfying book. Very dark, of course, but it would have to be because Harry must be left with nothing between him and Voldemort for the final reckoning. And that can\\'t happen without losing loved ones along the way. At least not in classic stories it can\\'t., we finally finished!!!!!, Last 200p i was just glued to the book. I was desperate to know about Voldemort\\'s past, Dumbledore\\'s \"investigation\", Half-Blood Prince... it is great book. Finally we get into the core of everything. \\n Main character and his friends grow up. Everything is just better, though darker and scarier. Till the end I couldn\\'t believe what happens in last 2-3 chapters. I am left in shock. I am desperate to start the last book in the series., Decided to reread Harry Potter as an adult and it is a totally different experience. This book is a particular gem in the series. Immensely enjoying the experience!, I\\'ve read this book and series so many times. I\\'m re-reading them again!, Actual Rating: 3.5 Stars \\n It seems I can\\'t seem to love these books as much as I want to. It was a good book - very well thought out and executed, yet it wasn\\'t enough for me to call it exceptional. \\n I think with this book, it was more of a personal problem for me. I love romance books - don\\'t get me wrong - but this one tested my limits. I can handle a MAX of 2 relationships at one time (and I\\'d prefer only one of them to be a major plot point). There was just too much sexual tension and angst for me. \\n We had Bill and Fleur in the beginning, and they were fine. Ron and Hermoine have their big over-arching romance going on this entire series. I loved the lead up to it from all the previous books, with the little moments of jealousy and protectiveness. However, their relationship in this book had too much tension, drama, and pettiness to be enjoyable for me. \\n I feel like Harry and Ginny\\'s relationship didn\\'t have enough lead-up towards it - at least from Harry\\'s perspective. It was basically Harry asking Ginny to join him/Ron and Hermoine a couple times and feeling disappointed when he was rejected (because of Dean). And then there was one moment of contact where he had butterfly-like feelings. This all would be fine if Ginny was some random girl, but Ginny is a friend - someone Harry has known for a long time. It would have been nice to have the transition from friendship to relationship fleshed out a little more. It was just too immediate. And then the ending where Harry was like: \"We can\\'t be together. It\\'s too dangerous.\" *Eye roll.* Could that be anymore cliche and annoying? I didn\\'t see him tell Ron and Hermoine that they had to stop being friends. Ugh. \\n And then there\\'s Tonks and Lupin. This one was just randomly thrown in there. All these relationships would have been fine if they weren\\'t all thrown in/peaking in the same book. It was too much for one book, in my opinion, and would have been better if they were spread out over the series. \\n In fact, I was talking about the horcruxes with a friend while reading this, wondering what they were. I was over half-way through the book, so she was surprised that they weren\\'t explained already and asked me: What has been going on in the book then? The answer: Nothing. Just relationship drama. The actual plot was basically at a stand still for the first half of the book. \\n That being said, the second half of the book was great. The idea of horcruxes is seriously cool, and it\\'s pretty awesome seeing Tom Riddle\\'s story. In this book, we got to see Dumbledore in a more human light - not just the great, untouchable wizard. He was funny and quirky and simply a delight. His adventure with Harry was super fun. And by fun, I mean creepy. \\n And then...THE ENDING. HOLY CRAP. THAT PLOT TWIST. Having lived for 18 years without reading the series, things are bound to get spoiled. So unfortunately, I already know that Snape turns out to be a good guy. It kind of sucks, but I\\'m still excited to see the reasoning behind his actions. And I definitely did NOT expect Snape to be the one to kill Dumbledore. \\n Ahh. The ending was just so action packed and climatic. Just awesome. Totally left me pumped for the finale., Interesting Quote: \\n \"Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\" \\n -Dumbledore/J. K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince [I think], Half-Blood Prince is arguably one of the best entries of this series. The best thing about it that I love is the insight in Tom Riddle\\'s past. It was dark stuff and it personified Voldemort instead of just keeping him a generic evil guy. There was a lot of little stuff that I didn\\'t remember reading before, which made me really glad that I chose to reread these books. On to the last one now., Just as good the 4th time around., My absolute favorite of the entire series! It was gripping, emotional, and as always, hilarious. Had me on the edge of my (metaphorical) seat!, My favorite of the whole series! I always love solving the riddle of the Title of the books and this one was the best. So glad I didn\\'t let myself watch the movie until I completed the book., I do pity the adult readers who overlook the HP series... \\n Yes, they\\'re written for young people, but does that make them any less credible? Time will tell (Dickens, Poe, Tolkien, Twain - all wrote for a young audience). \\n This is my favourite installment. The series came of age with Askaban and built to this - the storm, before the storm. \\n **** \\n Just read this book for the second time. Still my favourite due to the fact that it\\'s the series\\' denouement., \"You\\'ll never be gone as long as we\\'re here.\", ** spoiler alert ** \\n More of a mystery than some of the others, as entertaining as the rest. well, after having to come to face with the fact that Lord Voldemort is alive, the wizard community is in an uproar, and quite frightened. Cornelius Fudge has been sacked as Minister of Magic, and an Auror has been named in that position. Harry, Ron and Hermione get their O.W.Ls (Ordinary Wizardry Levels), and have to decide what courses to take for their N.E.W.Ts (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), something that will define their future careers. Plots abound, and danger is omnipresent throughout the book. But what\\'s the point of telling you all this if you can read the book, and enjoy, A wonderful, heartbreaking experience as always. Stephen Fry has a gift I cannot comprehend., Inte of The best books i have ever read! Beautiful story and language!, 2nd go around......., And my heart broke down into thousands of pieces at the end of this part. It was painful oh so painful. I have no words to describe how i feel now. I can only say that i want to continue till the end and fight this fight as though it is my own., This book is great!!! even when I wasn\\'t in the full mood to read it... I went through it. In this re-reading I discovered that I don\\'t like much the sectusempra chapter nor much when Harry follows Snape just after Dumbledore\\'s murder, or Harry being obssessed about finding out about Malfoy\\'s plans and literally giving up everything to know what he\\'s up to. However, this book is charming, pieces start to fall into place and is just an excellent reading. Definitively... this is my second favorite book!, I am almost afraid to read the last book. So upset, need to talk to somebody! I don\\'t know how the rest of you did it! I am leaving out for the library to get book 7. Then I can watch movie (Part 1) and go to the movies and see Part II!, This is an amazing book. First, it was my dad reading the Harry Potter series aloud to me and my sister at bedtime, but after a while, I realized I wanted to read the series my self. It was a beautiful series, it was Harry Potter and the twilight saga that introduced me in to the world of reading. I recommend this book for both young adults and children., Syf 2009 <3 \\n hn shtdWt l\\'Hdth kthyr .. wtbd\\' tTl` mfjat jdyd@ fy lqS@!, Version en espanol por editorial Salamandra. Y tambien en ingles por Scholastic (Tapa dura), I thought I was prepared for the end. \\n I wasn\\'t. I ugly cried and got through a whole pack of tissues., Ah. Sadness., excellent, Sobbing at 1 in the morning...., This book always makes me feel., Never judge a book by its movie. Although Harry Potter movies are quite amazing, still. Personally i never liked the movie as i myself felt very ashamed and helpless to witness Dumbledore\\'s fate and involuntary development of sympathy for Draco. But book is much more. What better way to rediscover your childhood than opening up a Harry Potter book? Especially one with the mysterious engravings of the half blood prince. I always avoided reading the part when Dumbledore drinks the potion in the cave but this time i did allow the grief to spread with a vengeance to rejoice upon Voldemort\\'s defeat in the next part, forgetting the fact that i have already read the series at least a hundred times., Story starts to lose its momentum here and get bogged down in complexity and unnessesary detail., Plenty of teenage romantic awkwardness to keep this 33-year-old enthralled. I can\\'t wait till J.K. Rowling writes the 7th book., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I still can\\'t believe Dumbledore is dead..Is it possible that I can feel even more grief and than Harry? Because I cried for almost an hour...I do love Rowling but I wish she hasn\\'t killed every single character Harry considered as his guardian.I loved the book though,just can\\'t wait to read the next book.It was a nice twist Snape being the half blood prince a athough I kinda guessed it, This is less a review and more a commentary. I\\'ve browsed others\\' reviews about this book and shockingly there were a few one-star and two-star ratings that blasted JKR\\'s writing ability. Really? She needs writing lessons? She wrote a best-selling seven-book series that captivated millions and millions of readers world-wide and was published in many different languages, not to mention 8 block-busting movies based on her series AND a theme park in universal studios completely dedicated to her little Harry Potter universe. Granted the movies and theme park have nothing to do directly with her writing, BUT had she not been such a talented and amazing writer AND storyteller (the two are not one in the same, don\\'t be fooled), weaving such an epic adventure that became endeared to readers spanning ages from small child to the elderly AND inciting hate and movement to ban from a few zealous demographics, OBVIOUSLY she doesn\\'t need writing lessons and she\\'s laughing at your miserable review all the way to the bank. There\\'s no opinion here, it\\'s pretty much fact that she\\'s not a bad writer and her success speaks for itself. Maybe you need reading lessons. \\n Ok I\\'m done. I\\'m slightly embarrassed to give such an impassioned rant, but less so because it\\'s Harry Potter, which is near and dear to my heart., Just in case you have been living in a media freeze and do not yet know which chracter dies in this book, I will not ruin it for you. I thought the last few chapters were heartbreaking. I felt every agonizing moment of it with Harry and wanted to hug Ron and Hermione for sticking with him. But, I also thought this was one of the funniest books yet. Rowling\\'s sense of humor is hilarious. Even at some of the moments where things can\\'t possibly get any worse--the characters come up with a one liner to relieve the tension. I love it. I am excited to see this as a movie., Read my review of the entire series here., ** spoiler alert ** \\n This was my second time reading this book - my problem with reviewing any book in the Potter series is that it\\'s hard for me to separate the individual book from the entire work, which is fabulous. \\n HBP has always seemed more like a transitional book before the seventh and final installment than a work of literature that stands on its own merits. \\n First, the positives: \\n There are very strong themes of Love and Good vs. Evil. Love as it applies to kids who are growing up and just learning what romantic love really means (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Lavender), and love as it applies to family and the sacrifices we are willing to make for our children (Lilly Potter, Narcissa Malfoy). Good vs. Evil can be seen both in Voldemort vs. Harry/Dumbledore, but HBP also explores the facets of good and evil within a person, in characters like Slughorn, Snape, and especially Draco Malfoy, as Dumbledore and Voldemort essentialy battle for his soul. \\n Slughorn is a fantastic character - the teacher who is more interested in collecting students like trophies and using them for their connections than in actually teaching them and earning their respect. Sadly, I have actually known teachers like this. He is manipulative, self-absorbed and self-involved but he is not a bad person. I think Rowling does a brilliant job of blurring the line between good and evil, creating characters who are not evil themselves but who allow bad things to happen. \\n The negatives: \\n [SPOILER WARNING:] Having read the seventh book, I know we are supposed to see Snape as a brave and noble. Re-reading the sixth, I find this impossible. Snape singles out a student, berates and humiliates him and is as nasty as a teenage bully. No adult should ever treat a child this way, especially not a teacher. I can\\'t like Snape after the way he treats Harry in HBP. \\n This book also suffers from poor editing. At times there is so much exposition I stop paying attention... plot points are hammered into the ground and there is often too much needless description... and there are a few passages that are just plain bad writing. \\n I was talking with some friends the other night about the Harry Potter series and whether it will be remembered as great literature. I love HP, but in the end I feel that its fame and hype may have been its downfall -- once Rowling and the series became a phenomenon, editors didn\\'t want to touch her work...and they didn\\'t have to, because they knew everyone would buy the books anyways. \\n HBP is a fantastic framework with excellent character development that could have been a great novel in its\\' own right if it were given the proper care. As is, it\\'s just a setup for the finale., A re-read! \\n Harry seems to be so stupid! Dumbledore points it out so many times. \\n The death of Dumbledore is so well written that i cry everytime i read it!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n My favorite book of the series as a stand alone. I love the 7th equally as much because it\\'s the end of the long saga. I love this one because of it\\'s mystery of what Draco is up to, Snape\\'s unbreakable vow, and all we get to learn about Voldermort. I also love the exploration of Harry and Dumbledore\\'s relationship all the more because Dumbledore distanced himself from Harry in the 5th book. Ginny and Harry get together. I\\'m so happy for her. She\\'s grown up quite a bit and Hermione\\'s advice did her good. Harry is just plain love struck. When I first read this I thought that his feelings came out of nowhere and was like whatever but this time I was happy for them both. Ron and Hermione continue to be awesome best friend even thought they fight too much for me. I also loved the mystery of the identity of The Half-Blood Prince. When Dumbledore died, I couldn\\'t believe it. When Harry vowed to finish what they started I felt emblazed. What a brave young man. This is a perfect lead up to the final book., Harry needs to shut his piehole. He can freaking fly., This is my favorite of the series. It is dark and brooding, and so many of our lingering questions are answered., It\\'s even sadder when you read it without the knowledge that Dumbledore\\'s death was planned the whole time , which was how the readers inevitably read it, barring any inconvenient spoilers. Very sad., You\\'d think that reading the ending to Half Blood Prince would be easier, the second time around, wouldn\\'t you. WELL, IT\\'S NOT., Albeit Harry\\'s life is getting more and more dangerous, Joanne still adds some spices in his life. Idk if this installment\\'s supposed to be sweet and \"nakakakilig\", but some of its chapters made me giggle and all! \\n P.S. JK Rowling wouldn\\'t just make you sad because of the death of her characters, but will make you mourn all throughout the book until the last few pages!!!, Buku harry potter seri 6 ini sedikit mencekam, karena menceritakan masa lalunya voldemort. Seolah2 kita dibawa ke masa lalu., This one was great, a different feel on the whole than the other books. I felt like this one was geared more toward girls because of the relationships. This one felt like more of a page turner than the first 5. Rating: 5 stars., Last read: December 2007 \\n Audio: January 2015, I read this book in about two days and it would\\'ve been most likely less than one if I didn\\'t have to work. Even so, I work at a library and would try to sneak in as many pages as possible while hiding in the stacks. \\n This book is the most rewarding of any series book I\\'ve ever read. You find out so much and the reader is constantly on the cusp of finding out something more and the world of Harry Potter becomes richer and richer. I wish I could wipe my memory clean just to be able to read the book again and enjoy the thrill of discovery once more! Yes, I\\'m aware of how geeky that is., Why kill Dumbledore???, I really liked this book too. It\\'s my second favorite of the series. Rowling kept me flipping pages through the entire novel., ***SPOILER ALERT*** \\n I have been very generous with my stars, I know. The decision was quickly made. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is by far the best book of the series (until now of course; I have very high expectations of the last book). What makes this book so great is that it combines the funny, enthralling and heart-warming daily life on Hogwarts with quite some tension, using Dumbledore\\'s private lessons which grant the reader a look into Voldemort\\'s cruel personality and then lead up to the final revelation: the Horcruxes. \\n As a girl it is my duty (and pleasure) to say that the romance also contributes to my five stars. The bond between the characters just keeps growing and is becoming more and more valuable. \\n Next argument: WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH SNAPE! The mystery about that man is as fascinating as it is frustrating. Based on common sense, one would say that he is completely evil. No matter the grounds, he did kill Dumbledore, he helped Malfoy escape the castle and he takes every chance to make Harry\\'s life as miserable as possible. But on the other hand, we all have blind faith in Dumbledore and in his beliefs, so there must be some kind of reason for him to trust Snape. \\n And at last: wow, what a beautiful, promising ending! I know, it\\'s a funeral, ironically, but Dumbledore\\'s death is the beginning of an adventure. Ron and Hermione\\'s unconditional loyalty to Harry makes it all the more gripping and exciting. I can\\'t wait to read about their journey., This was by far the saddest book so far! I am so sad!, Goodness, things get intense here. Harry goes through an interesting, routine sort of year at Hogwarts. I liked the introduction of the new character Slughorn. We learn about Voldemort\\'s past. Dumbledore treats Harry more and more as an equal instead of just a student. At the end, that mission, that fight, that death... no. Nothing will be the same without Dumbledore. And I can\\'t believe Harry still has all those Horcruxes to get rid of by himself! So much progress that needs to be completed in the last book! Dumbledore was so powerful and he was the reason Voldemort left Hogwarts mostly alone. What will even happen now? Certainly not a normal year. I\\'m glad McGonagall is the new Headmistress, though. But Dumbledore, he was the one who saved and guided and helped Harry immeasurably... aw... oh Snape! And why did Ginny suddenly get so popular and sought after? Why is Ron such an idiot to Hermione and Harry so often? Awaiting answers in The Deathly Hallows! :), Re-Read December 2012 \\n Re-read January 2012 \\n If I could give this book six stars I would. It is the Harry Potter book that I look forward to and enjoy the most. I\\'ll never forget the first time I read it, by the time I had read chapter 2 I was furiously texting my brother and telling him to catch up - I couldn\\'t believe what I was reading. It is fast paced, and you cannot put it down. It\\'s also fascinating because of the history that you learn of the characters, and the additional depth of the relationship between Dumbledore and Harry. \\n Absolutely excellent, riveting, fabulous. \\n Reread January 2011, Der...it\\'s awesome., nice things to know and learn that \"don\\'t judge the book by it\\'s cover\", When I started this blog, I never really thought that I would ever review any of the Harry Potter books. I\\'ve read and re-read them so many times and I know that many of you have read them as well, so I rather thought there wouldn\\'t be much of a point in reviewing any I happened to read. As it so happens, I like to re-read a Harry Potter book when its movie is coming out, and because I am in the habit of reviewing everything I read these days, I figured I couldn\\'t very well leave this one out. \\n I have to say that I truly think Rowling\\'s entire series is a masterpiece that is already a classic in its own time. Vividly written, though not necessarily perfectly written, the tales of Harry Potter never seem to disappoint (yes, some are better than others), and the Half-Blood Prince is no exception. I have to say that I was glad that this book did not have the angst-ridden quality that The Order of the Phoenix did--that was probably my least favorite of these books. Of course, the story continues to get darker, as we come closer to understanding more about Voldemort (or should I say, You-Know-Who?) and what it will take to defeat him. In my opinion, Rowling is an expert at keeping a reader on his or her toes and turning pages to discover the unfolding events. Even though I have read this book at least once or twice, I still found my heart pounding during some of the more suspenseful moments, and it is always emotional to read about the death of everyone\\'s beloved Dumbledore. And of course, there\\'s Severus Snape--he\\'s got to be one of the best characters ever composed on paper. Never have I read about someone and waffled back and forth constantly on whether or not to trust him (or her), and even still you cannot be 100% certain of the truth after reading this book. \\n One of the things that shines through in this book is the strong friendship between our main trio: Harry, Ron and Hermione. Through all the books and adventures, Ron and Hermione have stood by Harry, though that does not mean they have always agreed with him. And at the end of this book, when we know that Harry can\\'t possibly return to Hogwarts for his seventh year, we can rely on Ron and Hermione helping him on the next and final stage of this incredible journey. \\n Reading this book has made me long to pick up The Deathly Hallows--the only Harry Potter book that I have not read at least twice (well, I did listen to part of it a second time on a car trip). Whenever I sit down to read one of these books again, I\\'m amazed that I could have forgotten the incredible world that Rowling has created and so brilliantly painted on these pages. Even before the movies were born I could imagine the scenes and the events that took place. I personally did not start reading these books until well after The Goblet of Fire had been released, but it did not take me long to realize that I was reading a series that could very well become my all-time favorite. And The Half-Blood Prince could very well be considered the most important book of the series, though my own favorite is probably The Deathly Hallows... In my opinion, any flaws that can be found with Rowling\\'s writing pale when you realize the incredible story she has told in these seven books., The Half-Blood Prince not only continues the excellent writing from the previous installments, but improves. Every time I read it I am revved up and excited to jump into the Deathly Hallows. \\n I\\'ve mentioned in previous reviews of the Harry Potter series that Rowling is very skilled at character building and how artfully she writes mysteries giving just the right amount of information to keep the reader guessing yet still keeping the big reveal shielded without frustrating the reader. The Half-Blood Prince is a masterful example of those two skills. \\n We get to experience Dumbledore, Snape, and Tom Riddle like never before. Fleshing out their stories, but still leaving unknowns to explore in the finale. Snape is by far the best double-agent/\"is he good or is he evil\" story line I have read. \\n My Sorcerer\\'s Stone review \\n My Chamber of Secrets review \\n My Prisoner of Azkaban review \\n My Goblet of Fire review \\n My Order of the Phoenix review, This book is taking a while to read. Its pretty long and right now its dragging a little. I\\'ve been switching to other books recently., initial impression - 5 stars \\n reread # 2 (5/9/2016) - 5 stars, When I was 11 years old little girl who did not know much about the power of words, I saw this book on the shelves at my library... and something happened, I knew I must read it. Then, without any knowledge about Harry Potter or anything else about these books, I read the sixth instalment and instantly fell in love with its magical world. For this reason, HBP will always have a guaranteed place on my favourite book for it taught me how to love, live and breathe words, and as Will Herondale said \"it made me feel that perhaps I was not completely alone\". \\n From the magical pen of Joanne Kathleen Rowling comes sixth instalment about the magical world of Harry Potter and his friends, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Published by the Bloomsbury Children\\'s Books in 2005, this beautifully written tale about friendship and growing up, charts Harry\\'s latest adventures at Hogwarts with Rowling\\'s flawless skill and in her breathtaking fashion. \\n After accurately dubbed the Chosen One by the Daily Prophet, it is Harry unfortunate responsibility, according toProfessor Trelawney and brought to Lord Voldemort by Severus Snape, to destroy the evil that Lord Voldemort represents. Even though Harry has never run away from the destiny, bravely and repeatedly attempting to stop Voldemort, he is frustrated by the fact that he is unable to have a normal school life. He is well aware that he is not a perfect wizard and surely not the strongest student at Hogwarts for often it is Hermione who has to help both him and Ron with their homework assignments, and still neither of them can cast a perfect spell. Instead, his strength lies in his immense fidelity and trust he puts in his friends. In the Half-Blood Price, a reader can observe Harry\\'s maturing into a young wizard as evidenced in his romantic feelings towards Ginny Weasley and his increasingly loyal relationship to Albus Dumbledore. \\n One of the biggest symbolism in this book is surely the Half-Blood Prince\\'s book, which very soon took place as one of Harry\\'s most prized possessions, not only for the reason it assured him a role of the Potions genius, but because he sensed an unspoken connection to its owner. At first, Harry is convinced that the book might be, in fact, his father\\'s, which illustrates how much Harry wished his parent were alive. After one of his father\\'s closest friends, Professor Lupin told Harry that James had never referred to himself as \"Prince\", Harry is forced to accept that the book had never belonged to his father. Later, when Harry indeed learns who the Prince is, he will be even more heartbroken. \\n Beautifully written and marvellously composed, Harry Potter saga brought up an entire generation. I found it very compelling and educational for I found myself in Hermione\\'s character. There is one sentence in Harry Potter book which states how those whom we love never truly leave us, which perfectly sums up my feelings towards this book. On the whole, this is a piece well worth reading, and I would recommend it, not only to young readers, but to all those who have forgotten how it is to be young, and in love with a book., the best one so far, One of those books you could read over and over again without getting tired. Definitely the best from the entire series, OBVIOUSLY better than the movie (which was terribly done). Voldemort\\'s story is one of the things that are completely necessary to learn, very interesting and complete. \\n A must read, I get relieved after every book in this series because I can live my life again. These books make me obsess over them., My review of this just changed from 4 stars to 5 stars. It\\'s been a long time since I read this book, and I do remember why I gave it four stars, but rereading it again, this definitely feels like a five star book. It could just be the nostalgia factor, but still, this was a fantastic edition to the Harry Potter series., Mind-blowing!! You\\'ll never guess who the half blood prince is. \\n But your suspicion on who\\'ll going to betray them might be right. \\n Has one of the most grievous endings. Well i did not see that death coming though., ReRead: July 2015, Read the book again, July 2009, in preparation for the premiere of the movie., amazing book except for Dumbledore\\'s death., ****spoiler alert***** Once upon a time Harry witnessed the return of Voldemort and the death of his godfather, so he starts this book pretty bummed out. He goes back to Hogwarts and he and the gang think that Malfoy is up to something. Dumbledore has Harry put his head in a sink to absorb various memories, which lead them to a cave full of zombies, where Dumbledore has to drink a nasty potion to retrieve a necklace, which turns out to be a fake. Then, Malfoy lets the Deatheaters into Hogwarts through a magic cabinet, and Snape ends up killing Dumbledore, because Malfoy is too much of a little bitch to do it himself., I\\'m re-reading the first six before finally reading the last book in the series., I really, really liked this one. although, there were some sad parts. I got through this book a lot faster than the last two harry potter books. anyway, this one was amazing., Listened to the audiobook from Recorded Books. Read the hardcover when first published., My favourite of the series, for many many reasons, not just because I\\'m a ginormous Draco fan., It\\'s difficult to write a review for this book. The first three-quarters of the book could be renamed \"Harry Potter and Normal Life Inside of Hogwarts.\" Without something like the opening of the Chamber of Secrets or the TriWizard Tournament to give the plot a driving force, we spend a lot of time with Harry, Ron and Hermione in class, figuring out their love lives and worrying about Voldemort -- but in way that\\'s not immediate or dangerous. \\n But the ending! Oh, the ending! \\n ...and I\\'m not so much of a jerk to spoil the ending at all. \\n In this book, Harry is finally leaving boyhood behind and becoming a man. It\\'s uncomfortable for him and sometimes uncomfortable for the readers. His friends aren\\'t following him blindly any more, intent on being equals and not merely sidekicks. Everyone makes ridiculously stupid decisions and act like jerks about it. But it\\'s all okay, because it feels real. People are jerks, friends fight, people grow up and apart and they continue to struggle onward., Probably my least favorite of the whole series., Re-reading this one..., <3, I really am at a complete loss as to why I didn\\'t read these books earlier. They are one of my all-time favorite series\\' even though this book\\'s ending just broke my heart. I realize that most amazing books all have a big sacrifice aka some major IMPORTANT character who has a piece of my heart just goes and DIES but that doesn\\'t mean I have to like it. More to come after I read the final book - I\\'m immensely sad just think about how it\\'s the LAST book :(, Aside from my other notes about the renaming Harry Potter and the raging hormones. I was totally on Team Snape up until the last 100 pages. People informed the that the books get dark, but I feel like the scariest was still Azkaban. I pre-emptively borrowed booked 7 from a friend. I\\'m very glad I was able to read the series successively rather than having to wait years., Wow, I feel like this is the most powerful one for me so far., As someone who loves the Romione ship, this is probably my favourite book in the series. \\n I was so upset when I first read it and the beloved Dumbledore doesn\\'t get a good ending. I also hated Snape (wait until the next one Sophie!) Anyway, the ending made me want to cry so much and it was so dramatic that I just wanted to weep in a pillow for the next hour or so., It was another great Harry Potter story, for those of you who read it, you understand that the emotions werelike a roller coaster ride. Up and down cheering for the good guys., So, I wrote a review for this when I read it but accidentally deleted a whole bunch of reviews when I was reorganizing my shelves... So I guess I just have to read them all again so I can give accurate reviews :D, If it has one star I liked it a lot \\n If it has two stars I liked it a lot and would recommend it \\n If it has three stars I really really liked it a lot \\n If it has four stars I insist you read it \\n If it has five stars it was life changing, From my re-read of this series, I have determined that this is my least favorite Harry Potter book. We\\'ll have to see if that still stands once I\\'ve read Deathly Hallows again, as its been so long I don\\'t remember much from it. \\n Unfortunately, I can\\'t really figure out why I didn\\'t like this one as much. I think maybe because it has less humor, and less exciting little side stories? I\\'m really not sure. It just doesn\\'t have quite the same spark as the previous novels. \\n In this book we learn about Horcruxes through Harry\\'s lessons with Dumbledore. Harry is made captain of the Quidditch team, and the teen romances play a much larger role. Draco is up to something; Harry thinks he is a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione don\\'t believe him. The Half-Blood Prince and Harry\\'s potions book obviously play a large role, and his identity is finally revealed at the end. We learn the backstory for Voldemort as well., This is I think the darkest HP book, although the last book in the series comes a close second. I have not read this series in ages and therefore I think forgot a lot of the major plot points that are necessary for the final book in the series. \\n The main characters are again Harry, Ron and Hermione and this is the first book in which they are seriously thinking about having a relationship. There is some serious tension between Ron and Hermione as they both clearly have feelings for each other but are reluctant to say anything to the other. The other main thing affecting the story is Voldemort\\'s rise and Dumbledore\\'s plan for Harry which drives the whole book. \\n The secondary characters include the other Hogwarts teachers and pupils and the Order. Ginny comes into her own in this book and is a fantastic character. And for the first time Draco Malfoy seems to be a real threat. \\n The storyline is excellent and the pacing is great, full of tension all the way through leading to an almost shock ending (if I hadn\\'t read the book before). I am already reading the last book in the series but still appreciate all the little bits about this book. \\n 4.5 stars, This, on my 6th or 7th read now, may be my favorite of the series. \\n It is darker, has less funny moments but there is such development of the relationships throughout it. \\n The moment, for instance, in the hospital, after Bill has been savaged by Fenrir Grayback and Mrs. Weasley implies that Bill won\\'t be getting married now and Fleur fiercely defends him? It is always heart-wrenching for me to read, such love, they had so sadly underestimated Fleur. I sob and smile every time I read it. \\n And then the courage of Luna and Neville and why Harry believed of all the DA they were the ones to respond to the call the night the Death Eaters came? Gut wrenching. \"because they missed it the most\". \\n And there is still a great deal of humor as well. And always exactly when it is needed. Many is the time I laughed through tears during the Half Blood Prince., The best book so far. And my tears keep falling :-((((, I love this one! It\\'s just soo good!, 1st recorded reading: August 4, 2005, Love this one too! Though it always makes me cry. :-P, Definitely my favorite so far...probably because the romance is starting., One of the most moving of the series. It is in this book that we see Harry truly grow up. The fifth book shows Harry\\'s struggle to mature as he battles his emotions, but this book shows him learning to accept his role as the \"Chosen One\" and what that really means and the responsibilities that he will be shouldering, and most importantly choosing to accept all that means. There are great highs as Harry finds love; there are great struggles as he learns more about Voldemort and what lies ahead in their twined destinies, and there is devastation as great loss leaves Harry to face the final leg less one great supporter & protector., Imaginative and lively enough to provide light entertainment, yet provides and intriguing dark plot which captivates the reader., Nothing like some good old HP, This bok is gret except 4 1 thing...2 muchromance!!2 much!1, This was my favorite HP book so far! What a change--went from my least favorite to my now favorite. I loved all of the explained mysteries in this one; Ron and Hermione kept me laughing; the Ginny in the book is so much more riveting than the Ginny in the movie; the intricacies of Malfoy are fascinating; horcruxes have to be one of the most creative of Rowling\\'s plot twists, and I loved seeing the unity of everyone through this book. loved it!, One of the better Harry Potter books; I always seems to like the even-numbered books better. #2 will always have a soft spot in my heart, as it was near the beginning of my \"journey\" with Harry, but #6 is a great book. Wonderful imagination, J K Rowling., In no way do I diss Harry Potter, but I must say that I was really disappointed by the length of this book., I read this book twice now - and I had so much fun reading it the second time as well. I feel like I understand a lot more about Voldermort and Snape as well. I love everything about this book. I love J.K. Rowling and she deserves all the awards there are. I think I might read it again in a few years. It\\'s that good. \\n And now I\\'m reading it the third time :) \\n just finished it again.... and it was just so amazing!, SO many feels., great book, The insights into the life of Tom Riddle do not disappoint., No matter how much I already know about what\\'s going to happen...the end gets me every time. Also, book Ginny. Book Ginny is far more awesome than Harry deserves., The last books are way more darker then the first ones. I love it., Book #6, What began as a way to pass time during my commute and long trips has brought me all the way here. 6 audio books and a lot of hours later, the build up is over. It\\'s time for the climactic last book. \\n I\\'m no longer listening to fill the time. Instead, I\\'m listening to remember what made this series so special, and what gives it a lasting power over my students (and a fair share of family members). I had to put a moratorium on Harry Potter-related comments last month in an Intro to English Studies class just to get them to think past Harry Potter. But only for a day, lest my students\\' heads explode. \\n I\\'ll be honest, these are fun stories, sometimes overwritten (how many times can the adverb \"savagely\" be used and still be fresh? less times than Rowling uses it...), but I still don\\'t quite get it. But then, my wife still doesn\\'t get the power Monty Python has over me. \\n Maybe that\\'s slightly different., Read oon the blog!! \\n Okay before you guys say anything let me make one thing clear. I know that the whole world has read this book and nobody would even want a review for something this awesome but you see, I have to do it. I love this series and it\\'s not going away from me without at least a review. \\n So I started reading this series three months ago (yeah yeah I am stupid whatever). I was never actually interested in reading the books. I had seen all first five movies and half of the sixth one when I realised that I had to read the books to really grasp it all. \\n And so it began. The end of my normal life but the beginning of one so much more cooler. As I read on I realised how stupid I had been for not even thinking of reading it when the HP books were all around me because my whole class had read it and Beez was annoyed with me reading it now! when everything was over, the books, the movies, everything but I still read on and now I am obsessed. \\n This book is great. Everything from character building to the plot is perfect! I wish J.K.Rowling would come to me personally and smack my face for not having read this earlier. \\n If someone out there has still not read it, then read it, from the first book to the last and trust me you will never ever regret having read it. It\\'s a fantasy that is out of any of our imagination! \\n I love how finally we find out Voldemort\\'s weaknesses and the ending is just fabulous, I was sobbing for half an hour after the book was over and also laughing hysterically when I remembered all the punch lines that were in the book. \\n I rate it a 5 on 5. The best thing that has ever happened to me. I am officially a potterhead!! \\n Lots of love and pasta, \\n Raven, The Bible of Voldemort, ** spoiler alert ** \\n Ah, another excellent book in the series. \\n So why I\\'m not giving it five stars? \\n Two things. \\n First, it\\'s a very unsatisfactory ending. This book has portrayed Severus Snape as being truly evil, with zero explaination (which is left for the next book). Plus, it\\'s one of the most depressing books I\\'ve ever read. All other books enter in a much better way - yes, bad things happen, but then everyone returns back and while it\\'s not like \"they lived happily ever after\", there is an emotionally satisfying stasis. We don\\'t have that here. We have an emotional breakdown due to the death of Dumbledore. \\n Second, the love stories pissed me off quite much. \\n With the exception of these two things, this is a very good book., ** spoiler alert ** \\n FUCKING SNAPEEEE... and for awhile there i was rooting for him to be just a very withdrawn character with pure intentions. my heart is shattered. dY\\'\", Also read: \\n October 2006, ** spoiler alert ** \\n Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is by far my favorite book outside in and outside of the Harry Potter series. \\n The writing is simply superb and offers devoted readers into the depths of Voldemort\\'s past, while offering us some budding romance amongst characters. \\n I was constantly reading, and could not imagine putting the book down once I was at a good part. I thought that Harry\\'s teenagerish attitude was toned down in a pleasant way due to the fact that he was becoming so insightful into the mind of his greatest enemy and realizes that he must be the one to kill Voldemort. \\n Harry POtter has always been an emotional read for me, but the waterworks were multiplied this time as I cried at Harry\\'s trimuphs and tribulations. But, by far the saddest moment of my life so far has been Dumbledore\\'s death and funeral. I cried myself to sleep, resulting in squinty eyes and a palid complexion the next morning, but I could have cared less, because one of my favorite fictional friends has just died. Needless to say, I have never gotten over the shock and horror of it., z nwkh chwbdsty snyp nwr sbz rngy byrwn zd w drst bh qfsh y synh y dmbldwr khwrd. fryd wHsht hry hychgh z dhnsh khrj nshd. \\n skht w by Hrkht, mjbwr bwd dmbldwr r tmsh khnd khh bh hw prtb shd, w hmchwn `rwskh bzrg khhnh y z rwy khngrh h `bwr khrd w z nZr npdyd shd ..... \\n hry nmy dnst dmbldwr z khj zbn dryyy r amwkhth st. prssh hy zydy r hychgh z w nprsydh bwd.... chh Hrf hy zydy b w dsht..... dr an dm by hych hshdry, an Hqyqt drdnkh khmltr w nkhrnpdhyrtr z hr zmn dygry wjwdsh r fr grft. \\n dmbldwr mrdh bwd, rfth bwd..... \\n akhryn w bzrg tryn pshtybnsh z dny rfth bwd w w tnh tr z hr zmn dygry dr `mrsh bwd. \\n dmbldwr mygft bsyr mhm st khh khsy bjngd, w dwbrh bjngd w bh jngydn dmh bdhd zyr fqT dr yn Swrt st khh my twnd plydy r dwr ngh drd, gw ynkhh hychgh bh khly ryshh khn nmy shwd... \\n prgrf hyy z fSl hy akhr khtb . \\n w lbth yn jmlh y dmbldwr: \" ngrn nystm hry, chwn b tw hstm.\", What can I say? It\\'s a lovely addition to Harry Potter, (not my favorite like #5 or even #3). It deserves high marks all the same. \\n The important thing that this book contributes to the series: questions are finally answered. Character building is very strong in this one. \\n Number six runs a little slow for me, slower than usual. Some of this could\\'ve been explained in a mix of the last and next book, just to save time, I feel. Or maybe it was the fact I had to wrap my head around SO MANY plots in this book that I couldn\\'t concentrate. There were times I caught myself wondering about a different plot while reading one and got a bit agitated that we weren\\'t still on that subject. HOWEVER, I feel like all the plot points were necessary. \\n That\\'s basically it. I don\\'t want to spoil anyone with anything., Best book of the Harry Potter series. Can\\'t wait until the movie!, from all of harry potter book,this one is most favourite.not only on the storyline but the truth about half blood prince is PROF.SEVERUS SNAPE(what!xo) \\n (prof.snape is my favourite character!:)) \\n don\\'t forget about the death of prof.dumbledore makes us feels so sad & crying:(, Bloody good!, Oh my. This is definitely one of my favorites in the series. It was so great, and I love how J.K. Rowling writes. Now to see if I can finish the 7th one in nine days in time for the movie... :), One of the best compelling plots, which at the same time entwines with all the lose ends of the previous books of this series., Favourite Harry Potter book., oh severus you sneaky lil rat, Timeless masterpiece!, I can\\'t say much of how this books can give extraordinary excitements and I couldn\\'t wait to read the next one, Harry Potter is the best!!, Reread 2015: No matter how many times I read this, I always cry at the end. :(, I really forgot everything that happens in this book! A lot say this is their least favorite of the series, but I quite liked it. There were parts that got on my nerves...but it is certainly better than the chamber of secrets. I just can\\'t believe I forgot so much!, Okay there is no such thing as non-spoiler section in this review. Also how do you NOT know what happens? Even if you haven\\'t read the books? Excuse you, go educate yourself - read some HP, watch some HP, your life will be better I promise. OK \\n SO LIKE OKAY \\n Basically this is my FIRST time ever reading this book. I know, I know, for shameeeee. I technically didn\\'t even read it - I audiobooked it, it was really fun. \\n I wasn\\'t really surprised that the book is different to the movie. Like really different. I\\'ve seen the movie so many times, that when I was reading the book it was a different experience which I loved. I can\\'t say I love one more than the other, because I think the movie, as a movie and NOT as book to movie adaptation, was really well done and it\\'s like solid. \\n Kay let\\'s start - I loved the whole Mrs Weasley not liking Fleur (is that even how you spell it? idk). I never knew that and it was really funny how both Ginny and Hermione called her Phlegm. \\n I was a bit frustrated with Drako and Snape and Dumbledore. \\n But can I first talk about how Harry got so obsessed with Drako, that if it was read out of context, it seemed like he had a crush on him and had to know where he is and what he is doing at all time! Everytime he was thinking about him I was laughing because I was like yeah ok calm down Harry. \\n I loved how in the book Harry actually gives Ron, Hermione and Ginny his liquid luck potion. That is very Harry of him. Although, i did kinda want to see him high on in like he is in the movie. Always made me laugh, that part. \\n Anyway, Draco has to kill Dumbledore, Snape makes the unbreakable-vow to help and protect Draco, and takes that as a licence to annoy the shit out of me. I cannot stand him. Seriously. \\n OK so the Half-Blood Prince. I found that soooo hilarious. Like, obviously I know it\\'s Snape and all that, but I was just sitting there like \"Why does he gives himself a nickname???\" and then you know it turns out it\\'s his mother and I\\'m still sitting there like \"No really, why?\" \\n So he invents all these dark spells, we know from past books that he is like obsessed with the dark-arts, and like I\\'m suppose to like him? How to people like Snape? I get he has a \"dark and sad\" past, well boo-hoo he is an asshole, and just no, bye. \\n and SNAPE was the one who told Voldemort about the prophecy. That\\'s what he did to piss me of so much. \\n Ok the whole Horcrux business - basically Dumbledore and Harry go to this Cave where mini-Voldemort went that one time and tortured little kids or something (why)? And like they go in this boat and Harry sees hands. What were those? I never quite understood what were the dead bodies in the water? \\n And at the end I felt horrible because we didn\\'t even get an actual Horcrux. So Dumbledore torturing himself by drinking the weird potion and all the trouble they went thought was for nothin, it was heart-breaking! \\n Umm so we go back, the dark-mark is casually chilling on top of the Astronomy tower. We fly there, Dumbledore immobilises Harry under his cloak, and then he has like this nice long chat with Malfoy, just...just chillin. it\\'s all good. But he manages to convince Draco, because his wand slowly like goes down, and isn\\'t aimed at Dumbledore anymore and I was just like, yes that\\'s right, put the stick down! \\n And then all them death-eaters come upstairs and even though I\\'m not a huge Dumbledore fan, I still liked him a lot and I just go \"well...maybe he deosn\\'t die in the books?\" \\n Nope. He dead. \\n I like the way Harry is dealing with Dumbledore\\'s death. Like so far, he isn\\'t being angsty and weird, like he was when Sirius died, he is accepting it and I\\'m like yas character developmenntttttt!!! \\n Ron and Hermione this book - Oh. My. God. It was ridiculous. Ron and Lavender, who I do not like since book one I think cuz she was and always is, a bitch to Hermione, were just ....ugh. I couldn\\'t. I felt Hermione. I was like ye bae, I know, I know. You get to marry him though, so chill out. \\n I loved Ginny and Harry. I loved them together. I like Book Ginny more than I like movie Ginny - she is more badass, whereas Movie-Ginny was just kinda...there, if that. And I found it heart-breaking that Harry broke up with her at the end to protect her. Ahhhhhhh shipppppp \\n Ummm I don\\'t know what to say. I loved it. I am happy I read it because I\\'ve been missing out on a lot! I\\'m going to re-read/re-listen to them again this year, this summer or at the end of the year. \\n My favourite part was when Harry and Snape are having an argument in class and then Harry goes \"Yes\" and Snape is like \"Yes, SIR!\" and then Harry goes \"No need to call me \\'sir\\', professor\". I was laughing my ass off in the train on my way to school. People were staring at me weirdly. I don\\'t care. It was hilarious! \\n What\\'s your favorite part of the book? Who is your fave character? Do you like Snape? Why? Don\\'t he\\'s an abusive creep who bullies little children because his life is shit and he never got the girl so he is forever angsty and responsible for the death of Harry\\'s parents AND for what Harry\\'s life is right now. \\n Kay, that\\'s it! Bye :), can\\'t see my screen through the tears this re-read has been MOST painful and utterly worth it, Awesome like all others with the difference that this one is a heartbreaker too!, Absolutely fabulous!!! 5/5, I think this was probably my favorite of all., I reread this book because of when I watched the movie trailer I was shocked..forgot some details! It was an inconvenience circumstance. I don\\'t wanna miss some great details of this book, esp. when Dunmbledore dies., This book drags quite a lot, doesn\\'t have the urgency of order of the phoenix, harry\\'s obsession with malfoy is annoying and often his actions are inexplicable, quite unlike himself. however, if sirius\\'s death was a shock incapable of sinking in, dumbledore\\'s death is just cruel and heartbreaking. sirius did not have as much time to grow upon the readers as dumbledore did, who was the most pronounced embodiment of the qualities that make the positive forces of the potterverse. in many ways, his character was more attractive than potter himself. as I said before. I found the book drags quite a lot and gets irritating. the potion making book of the half-blood prince for example. i thought it was voldemort\\'s so i was quite shocked to discover it was snape\\'s, but is harry so dumb as to never figure out that someone positively dark had used that book? however, the book does pick up from the chapter called the cave. the power and spirit of dumbledore prevades and snape\\'s firm and unhesitant killing of dumbledore is just devastating for the reader. the phoenix\\'s lament is a befitting tribute to the loss of this major character, but the spiderman twist in the end of harry leaving ginny because he has great responsibilities for his great powers is well, repetitive. a note on stephen fry\\'s narration. Not only can he create a gallery of characters with his voice acting, his impersonating of maggie smith, robbie coltrane and alan rickman is just spot on!, This book is very much more about the origins of Voldemort than the others were. So far, my least favourite of the series (next to the Goblet of Fire). Harry is in top form here, though- not the whiny, angry brat of the previous book, and he gets quite a bit snarkier, which is nice. However, I don\\'t think I could really get into it because the first three quarters is rather boring- mostly it\\'s just teenage wizard drama, which is only slightly more interesting to me than normal teenage drama (that is to say, not very). The story really seems to lose its way here. The ending, though, was action-packed and lovely, which I hope is a sign of things to come for Deathly Hallows, and not just the beginning of a painful decline., Ame este libro., Initial thoughts: My anger at what happened towards the end of this book is overshadowing how I feel about it as a whole. Review to come when the rage dies down. \\n Review: \\n Actual rating: 4 Never-Have-I-Ever-Felt-So-Much-Rage stars. No spoilers. \\n I\\'m not even going to attempt to write a full review for this book. Why? There\\'s a bazillion other detailed reviews out there. Instead, I will share with those of you that are reading this my feelings on this book. \\n I reached a poignant section towards the end, and found myself yelling at the book. \\n I was on the other side of the country at the time I read this. I\\'d just gone to Harry Potter World at Universal Studios Orlando with my fellow book nerd friend Annette and our husbands. So I got the itch to read this one. I borrowed her hardback copy of it. If it hadn\\'t been for that, I would\\'ve taken my rage out on the book. \\n I sent some very hateful and rage-filled messages to my friend Annette. Not directed at her, of course. I needed to vent. I hated Rowling for what she did. \\n I said I wasn\\'t even going to finish this book after that part. I walked away from it. I wouldn\\'t have finished it or even completed the series if Annette hadn\\'t twisted my arm and convinced me to. \\n I calmed down. I finished the book. I finished the series. And I haven\\'t written Rowling off my list of authors I will read. However, I don\\'t agree with what she did. Annette tells me it\\'s necessary for the story. But that doesn\\'t mean I have to like it. The rest of the book was sooooo good, I can\\'t avoid giving it less than 4 stars. My rage almost put this on the DNF shelf with 1 star though..., God, I lost it at the end. It just seemed that by now everyone should have learned to listen to Harry. But no they didn\\'t and that happened. One of the best reads of my life., Always wish we could see more of Harry and Ginny\\'s cuteness, Started September 12th... \\n Finished September 16th.., All them feels. Every dang time., You know what is wholly amazing about rereading these books? You pick up on teeny tiny little things, that BRING elements of the whole story together. \\n \"The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog\\'s Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was. \\n \"Mundungus!\" \\n THIS SCENE IS MUNDUGUS SELLING SIRIUS\\' MIRROR TO ABERFORTH HELLO CAN WE APPRECIATE HOW THIS IS TRULY WONDERFUL. \\n Sorry this is a waste of a review, it was too long to post as a general update, and I felt like I had to say it., It\\'s hard to keep lavishing praise on this series without just saying the same old things, but this was so close to perfect you couldn\\'t fit Mrs Norris\\'s whisker into the space. \\n Harry finds a textbook that belonged to the \\'Half-Blood Prince\\', with notes in the margin that produce superior potions to anything he (or indeed Hermione!) has ever pulled off before. Meanwhile, Dumbledore begins to take Harry through Voldemort\\'s backstory in more detail. Draco Malfoy has a task set by the Dark Lord and Snape, as ambiguous as ever, has an interest in the outcome. \\n Professor Slughorn is our new addition to the cast, and he\\'s brilliant. Pompous, narcissistic and one of the old boys, he brings colour to a dark novel, and he has secrets of his own that turn out to be very important. \\n Rowling toys with the teenaged protagonists\\' hormones more than ever. Ron and Hermione are involved in a will-they/won\\'t-they stramash with Victor Krum and Lavender looming large on the outskirts, meanwhile Harry has his sights set on Ginny (slightly awkward vis-a-vis Ron, never mind Cho). OK, let\\'s be honest and admit that we all know this came from nowhere. Harry literally didn\\'t give a wand\\'s sparkle for Ginny until now, and Ron wasn\\'t exactly concealing a jumping bag of chocolate frogs of lust for old Granger either, but let\\'s go with it. \\n It ends, as Potter likes to these days, with a gut-punching twist. As if Cedric and Sirius weren\\'t bad enough. But this one\\'s a belter, and its implications cannot be overstated. It\\'s going to haunt you until Book 7, and becomes only the third book that\\'s ever made me cry. (The last was Memoirs of an Imaginary Friend, by the way.) \\n A stonking penultimate book that leaves you panting for the finale., Me encantaria leer toooooooda la historia de lord Voldemort, lo que se relata en este libro es muy fascinante. \\n Dumbledore sin duda es de mis personajes favoritos, la sabiduria que tiene es demasiada, !Aprendes mucho de el!. Me dolio su perdida pero no, no fue en vano. \\n Como todos hasta el momento odio a Severus, pero se viene el siguiente libro y ahi cambia la cosa. \\n Lord Voldemort es de mis villanos favoritos, sea lo que sea, es uno de los grandes. \\n La fidelidad del ED y de la Orden del Fenix para proteger a Harry y al mundo magico es mucha, el amor que se inicia con algunos personajes es muy bello, los valores que se ven en HP deberiamos practicarlos mas. \\n Esta relectura hace que recuerde cosas que tenia olvidadas de esta hermosa saga con la que inicie en el maravilloso mundo de la lectura, en particular este libro es el 3er favorito de la serie. <3 \\n \"La grandeza inspira envidia, la envidia engendra rencor y el rencor genera mentiras\" \\n -Lord Voldemort \\n \"Lo unico que nos da miedo cuando nos asomamos a la muerte y a la oscuridad es lo desconocido\" \\n -Albus Dumbledore, Great book. One of the sadest, but great indeed., This was amazing! I love all the humor in this one! It is perfection like the Harry Potter series itself!, and the saga continues...can\\'t get enough, Phewwwwwwwwwww. That was....... nice. \\n (These sentences are from my old review... lol ---->) NO! and my favorite pheonix Fawkes!!! Oh my dear characters! They\\'ve grown so much!, October 2009 - the book version \\n My blog post about this book is at this link. \\n 9/10/10 - audio version \\n My blog post about the audio version is at this link., I thought this was the scariest one yet-and parts of it are so hard to read... things are all explained in the following book but this was one tough., Oh man. I ended this book and felt incredibly depressed for the next few hours. All I want to see about it is WHYYYYY? Now on to my actual review. Harry seriously got on my nerves, but in a good way if that makes any sense. He was so sure of Malfoy being up to something and ofcourse when noone believed him he wouldn\\'t take no for an answer. This annoyed me because he always does this! However, he was right and his determination proved a lot. I think it is amazing just how supportive Ron and Hermione (and now Luna and Neville) are of Harry and this whole terrifying situation. One of the many things Rowling is good at is showing true friendship. The discovery of the Horcruxes is truly the beginning of the end. It is like finally! After all this time there is a reasonable answer instead of endlessly searching for any sort of clue. I feel this book was a great set up for the 7th book. Last, but not least, the half-blood prince. When I read through this book the first time I had a pretty easy time of figuring out who this was and I knew it would blow up in Harry\\'s face, but I think it was an important part of looking into Snape\\'s personality and development as a character. oh no! Now I am on the last one....I have my tissues ready., Me costo mas de un ano terminar de leer este libro, pero al fin lo hice, y si bien, no es el que mas me ha gustado, dire que las ultimas 200\\'s paginas me gustaron bastante., How does each one keep on getting better than the last? This defies series rules. 1st one hooks ya 2nd one leads you on like a tease. 3rd one disappoints 4th one lays it out, 5th=???? brings you back but you miss that old feeling, last one wraps it up. Sometimes good sometimes not. \\n Anyway this series is like wine- as harry ages, each book gets better., Read in 3 days when it came out, This was a gorgous book I devoured it all in one sitting! Love it!, LOVED this series!, DUMBLEBORE, I was satisfied and I was completely devastated. I don\\'t know if it\\'s because of The \\'Rent, but I almost dread what\\'s going to happen when I re-read Order of the Phoenix, later this week. \\n HP and the HBP is, definitely, a set-up book. There was really no sense of urgency as I read the book. It was merely background information that will become useful in the closing volumes of the series. I even found all of the information interesting, but I think that, to an extent, Rowling gave away the prize by featuring Dumbledore so prominently. I kept thinking that this is a fake Dumbledore or that at some point it would become crucial for Harry to be able to tell the difference between the real!D and the fake!D. Unfortunately, I was not prepared, nor did I even guess what the actual ending would be. \\n In a way, the ending of HBP makes me NOT want to finish the series. I will, of course, but I was very devastated by the ending and like Harry I think that the light at the end of the tunnel has dimmed considerably. Which, of course, may have been Rowling\\'s point entirely. She has become excellent at mimicking the rhythms of real life. Just when things are really good, everything goes to shit with almost no warning. So, there is our Hero. Flying high on the House Quidditch Cup win, a shiny, new girlfriend, and ever increasing knowledge of his enemy -- then WHAM!! Disaster Strikes. We should not be so surprised. I was. \\n Another thing that surprised me was Harry\\'s sudden interest in Ginny. Although, it did make a sort of sense and I didn\\'t mind that they were ultimately paired. I think that the whole, I am Destined and we can\\'t be together because of Danger was a little over the top, but other than that I was very satisfied with the easiness of their relationship. And as these things usually happen the way that Harry\\'s affection for Ginny is a sort of dawning. \\n Rowling has indeed grown as a writer, her storytelling in HBP was, I thought, tight and well constructed. At a whopping 652 pages, I felt as if there wasn\\'t a wasted word. Everything had a purpose and felt essential to either this narrative or to what\\'s to follow. \\n The way that the opening two chapters focused on the outside world instead of Harry was a rather nice touch. Expanding the narrative and demonstrating the danger Voldemort poses on the world stage. Up til now, it has largely been about Harry and the Wizarding World. I thought that the Other Minister was a great way of making the threat a much larger one. \\n Snape surprised the shit out of me, and I find myself still holding out hope that it\\'s all a hoax. He can\\'t really be a bad guy, Dumbledore trusted him so. \\n Dumbledore can\\'t REALLY be dead. He\\'s the Hero\\'s Champion. I mean, even Merlin survived the destruction of Camelot. Of course, there is the whole Phoenix theme, and I can only hope that\\'s a sort of warning. \\n Loved the way that Rowling humanized Malfoy. Hitherto, he\\'s been largely just a petulant, spoiled, spiteful bully. He has become, like Snape in Order of the Phoenix, a much more complex and empathetic character. \\n The interactions among students, as hero\\'s, wizards and teenagers was awesome!! Harry and Ron and Hermione especially. The birds!!!!! I laughed my ass off. That\\'s what he gets. I was a surprised at Ginny\\'s malicious teasing of Ron. Although, he seems to generally be the family pick-upon, she was a little more vicious than I would have thought. \\n I was completely unspoiled for this book, unlike Order of the Phoenix, which still had me on tenterhooks. I\\'ve decided to stay that way through the close of the series. Let\\'s cross our fingers that everything turns out well, because even through Harry is Our Hero and this is an Epic Battle between Good and Evil, I feel that with JK Rowling anything is possible. Everything in the Potter-verse comes with a price. Nothing is ever for free. There\\'s always a sacrifice or a trick or a catch. Not unlike real life. I like that about Rowling. I like that about the Harry Potter series., It keeps getting better. After Goblet of Fire, I was blown out of my comfort zone and started down a dark path. Order of the Phoenix added to it, by showing just how far the enemy infiltrated the world. Now, in the Half-Blood Prince, we finally can see the light at the end of the tunnel, the darkest days with a small glimmer of light, hope. This emotional roller coaster of a novel is the best thus far. Deserves a full 5 out of 5 stars and just screams, ready part 7 immediately after., this was really a sad book but I liked the charactwr development a lot more in this one the previous books., Re-read Christmas 2015 :), ** spoiler alert ** \\n Excited me through the first two thirds of the book...then... \\n Dumbledore died... \\n ;( \\n I cried..., Loved it!!, **********5/5********* \\n To Ms. J.K. Rowling, \\n Biggest plot twist ever and this book actually surprised me for Miss J.K. Rowling\\'s attempts to romance! I loved it to bits!, My favorite! Cried my eyes out!, After this latest re-read, I think book 6 just jumped up spots to become my favorite of the entire series., Dead., This book made me sad. Saddest ending of the series., This is, in my opinion, the darkest of the seven books. It contains a lot of background information on Voldemort. The Pensieve is truly one of the most clever literary devices for dealing with flashback I have ever encountered. Although I loved this book at the time I read it, the author\\'s announcement following the publication of the 7th book bothers me so much that I can\\'t possible give any of them 5 stars., 2nd read before movie #8, A good number six on a long series. \\n I liked getting to see different sides of well known characters. How Draco fears for his and his families life but doens\\'t really want to hurt anyone. Harry and Ginny finally get together, we finally get to know more about Snapes history and start the real work finding horcruxes. \\n I wasn\\'t fond of the scene with Dumbledoor and harry in the cave. It was meant to be scary, but I found it ludicrous. I did like the scene where Snape saves Draco\\'s ass and kills Dumbledoor. Snape is my favourite antihero ever!, The Best Potter book for me Snape is so...great.), What can I say? I am a big Harry Potter fan of the 7 books and movies. I loved them all. They also roped my oldest son into the greatness of books., The one movie that really doesn\\'t do the book justice. How can you make a movie of this and not include the lines: \\n \"Hello Harry, did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?\" \\n \"I am a wizard and not a bumbling baboon with a stick.\", I absolutely loved the book due to the fact jk. Rowling added a lot of love drama between Ron and hermione which I absolutely love, because I think it is very funny and if is so cute how the two acted around each other. I really enjoyed seeing through Tom riddles memory,the imagery was perfect. My favorite part of the book was when dumbledor was killed because I was thinking in my head when reading, how could snape kill someone that was trusted by dumbledor. And why didn\\'t dumbledor believe harry when he said snape was really trying to hurt them instead of helping the. The book is so dramatic which makes it very intriguing to read, I would reccomend this book who lives memories and who is a scrap booker, you know, the person who likes going back and reliving their memories, just like how dumbledor did with harry. \\n Thanks, Great come back after a disappointing Book 5!, I love Harry Potter!!!, Not quite as bad as the next one but still pretty horrible, I really enjoyed the suspense in this novel. I liked this book on par with Goblet of Fire, but not as much as Chamber of Secrets. I think it\\'s a good story this time and the ending did leave me sad., I am listening to this book for about the 6th time. I need a story which will carry me along without much effort and yet capture my interest and challenge me to see more than I saw the last time. There are confusing times in my life when this comfort read is exactly what I need and Rowling and Jim Dale, the narrator, always deliver. \\n In this book, Harry finds a potions book from a former student and when he follows the instruction, he produces extraordinary results. Hermione is deeply troubled by the book and insists that he turn it in. Who is the Half-Blood Prince? \\n It is hard to review this book without giving the plot away, so I will stick to the generalities. We learn a lot more about Tom Riddle and how he came to be Lord Voldemort. The reader begins to have a little sympathy for him...until he reveals his cold bloodedness at such a young age. It goes way beyond the mind of a schoolboy. \\n We get to see a lot more of the pensive and it begins to reveal the prequel to the stage that is set for Harry when he comes to Hogwarts. I think the pensive is an absolutely brilliant device. I would love to have one myself! Suddenly, Harry is there, seeing the people in the past as they were without being interpreted by flawed memories. I think the memories also reveal the depth of Rowling\\'s talent. She has constructed these books as if she knew from the very beginning just where she was going every step of the way. Tiny bits of information in book 1, come back in book 6 and their importance is revealed. In fact, I think that is why I keep coming back to these books. I make connections that completely eluded me up to that point. I am in awe of the depth of her organization for what is ostensibly juvenile fiction., NOOOOOOOOO!! I have so many questions! *immediately starts book seven*, This is easily my favorite of the series thus far. Relationships are more interesting, better pacing and the overwhelmingly detailed, metaphorical \"Quidditch match\" chapters have been almost eliminated. The good experience i have coming off this one has given me the intestinal fortitude to muscle through the final 700+ pages of the final book without pause. Fate challenges Ursus to achieve greatness. FOLLOW!, Re-read! :3 six down one to go, I have read all the harry potter book series over and over and i never get sick of it!, Speechless. Need to quickly start book 7..., My favorite in the Potter series., In an unprecedented bold move, Dumbledore appoints Snape to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, taking an old teacher to replace him. Harry suddenly starts doing really well in potions classes because his textbook is annotated with notes from someone called the Half-Blood Prince. Harry and Dumbledore work together on researching evil Voldemort\\'s past through the use of a magical tool called a Pensieve; it reads memories, and the two are looking into the past experiences of those who have been in Voldemort\\'s presence or knew him when he was younger. When they realize Voldemort preserved himself by creating \"Horcruxes\"--items that contain a part of the soul and prevent death--Harry knows they\\'ve got to destroy the Horcruxes to get rid of Voldemort once and for all. He goes about his year watching his friends Ron and Hermione bicker with each other and have a romantic falling out, and wants to date Ron\\'s sister but is unsure if this would hurt his relationship with Ron. When Harry and Dumbledore go searching for a Horcrux in a cave, they may be on the path to destroying another part of Voldemort . . . or their plans could backfire horribly. \\n This had many exciting parts, and I liked the realistic teenage drama of the kids and their dating anxieties, and I especially liked the complexity of Dumbledore and Snape\\'s different loyalties. It was a good straightforward story this time, without too much babying of Harry; in previous books it seemed like nobody ever trusted him even though he\\'d fought Voldemort and won (sometimes doing so only because he disobeyed adults); this time he\\'s working directly with Dumbledore. The ending was pretty shocking too. But I think if I wasn\\'t already riding on attachment to previous books, I wouldn\\'t have found it all that captivating; some of the plot points seemed practically random or very new to a series that\\'s about to be over., Love. Harry Potter series is the best. Slightly scarier than previous. Definitely recommend growing up with the books as I did. Start the first when you are 11/12 and read one/two a year as you go., My favourite of the series, there is so much in there! We learn much more about the other characters that we have long been as curious about as Harry!, I can\\'t even think about this book without crying., The Best books i have ever read! J.K. Rowling is a wizard herself through her writing. I am so excited for her new adlut series, I\\'m going to read them anyway!, My least favorite book as Harry does some very silly things. However it is still highly relatable and full of teenage boy angst!, I loved it!!!! It is an amazing book like all of J. K Rowling\\'s books, Jeg havde glemt, hvor meget jeg elsker den her. Jeg tror maske, at det er min favorit af de 7. Men det er jo umuligt at vaelge...., This book is where everything starts to build up into the grand finale. The book begins to bring in more plot development and a lot more character development. This leads to a great book to read as each page brings more excitement and vigor into reading the book. \\n Even though this book is not my favourite in the series, re-reading it has made me like the book more than I had done before. This book is also good for re-reading as you know more in hindsight and so you can appreciate all of the hints and the clues that are leading up to the last book., I loved trying to figure out who the half-blood prince was!, Merged review:Am re-reading in preparation for July 15th!, Something about this book that made like it less than the previous, but it was still loads of fun of course. I didn\\'t get finished reading the entire HP series in 2016, but I\\'m sure I will this year. Now, if only finishing all Steve Kings books were so easy. \\n I\\'ll read book 7 soon., I almost cried my eyes out., I could NOT put this book down!! Here we are nearing the end of the series, and so everything ties together a little more. Throughout the book, I was happy, upset, and mostly shocked!, Great book, Less annoyed by Harry, but now I can predict what is going to happen, which is annoying., Lovely read..., Dear JK. Rowling, \\n Why do you have to kill all of my favorites character? \\n I cried when I found out Dumbledore passed away and when I watched the movie I was like, \"That\\'s it?\", jeez, i forgot how long some of these books are., Better each time I read it. [?], There is an popular school of thought which says that as soon as an author becomes very successful (in the sense that people might actually buy their books rather than the Guardian Review section stating the author has a narrative voice reminiscent of early Banana Yoshimoto), it is pure intellectual snobbery to claim that he or she is nowhere near as talented as is generally suggested and that other, far more obscure writers are considerably better and more worthy of adulation. \\n This is, of course, sometimes true, but in general it\\'s just so much hot air, designed to help people avoid any actual thinking about whatever it is that they\\'re reading and to instead continue to believe that high book sales are a sure fire sign of literary quality. \\n In fact, extremely popular authors tend to fall into two categories. \\n First and best, are those writers who are genuinely very good at all levels of what they do (Terry Pratchett for the fantasy/sf crowd; Marian Keyes for the chick-litters and so on) - their writing is solid and well-done, their ideas are witty and original; their characters, within the scope of their chosen genre, rounded and believable. In general, no-one tends to come out and say \\'Terry Pratchett is a very poor writer of dialogue\\', for the simple reason that evidently he isn\\'t. \\n The second group are those authors who really aren\\'t very good at writing, but who can churn out intriguing, if often illogical, plots which hold the attention in much the same way that soap operas do. Jeffrey Archer although apparently a self-serving ex-criminal, is the most obvious example of this second breed (as a teenager I once read Archer\\'s Kane and Abel whilst on a family holiday in a B&B in Fort William and it was perfectly acceptable stuff - certainly much more attention-grabbing than the pile of Zane Grey westerns which were the place\\'s only other literary offerings). People frequently do come out and say things like \\'Jeffrey Archer is a very poor writer of dialogue\\' which is fair enough comment because equally evidently he is exactly that. Which is not to say that he can\\'t tell a story - and that is an accusation not often levelled at him. \\n All of which apparent digression brings me to JK Rowling\\'s penultimate Harry Potter book, \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\". One in three hardbacks sold in the UK are written by Ms Rowling and, if the papers are to be believed, she made PS20 million in the first day of sale of this novel. The series regularly tops reader polls as best children\\'s books ever and Ms Rowling is now the richest woman in Britain (possibly the Universe). She was even, it is rumoured, invited by Russell T Davies to write a story for the rebirth of smsh hit tv series, \"Doctor Who\". To suggest that Ms Rowling is a less than stellar writer and that - for instance - Ursula K LeGuin\\'s \"Earthsea\" trilogy is so far above Harry Potter as to be invisible is presumably just the type of intellectual snobbery mentioned above. \\n And yet her new book is - and apologies in advance for the profanity - bloody awful. \\n So awful that it would never have been published had it been written by anyone other than JKR. \\n So awful that even the sycophantic drone at Bloomsbury who...ahem...edits the Rowling manuscripts must have winced. \\n So awful that even the author appears to recognise that she\\'s putting no effort in any more. \\n So awful that everyone involved should be throughly ashamed of themselves. \\n \"The Half-Blood Prince\" has the story\\'s hero spending much of his time (several hundred pages in fact) doing something which does not need doing, simply in order (a) to have him doing anything at all and (b) waste some time. Dumbledore clearly already knows what has passed between Professor Slughorn and Lord Voldemort, so there is no need for Harry to spend so much time on the subject, other than artificially boosting the pagecount. What makes this particuarly galling is that Rowling knows that what she\\'s doing is rubbish - there\\'s even an explicit reference to the fact that the hero need not have been Harry but could just as easily have been the ineffectual Neville. \\n We should, however, really be glad that Rowling\\'s third-rate rip-off of the Origins of Gollum section of Lord of the Rings (which makes up much of the \\'plot\\' and which is the supposed reason for Harry\\'s enquiries of Slughorn) does take up such an incredibly large part of the book as it at least prevents Rowling shoe-horning in yet more tedious, badly written and shallow bits of teenage love and snogging. This is a book bought mainly by ten to fourteen year olds after all, and if they want romantic teen angst they can presumably go out and buy a Jacqueline Wilson book, rather than this hand-me-down tat. \\n In any case, once the \\'Lord Voldemort is Smeagol\\' and \\'Harry meets Ginny\\' sections are over, there\\'s only about 150 pages left of the 607 page book and we\\'re heading helter-skelter for the Obligatory Dead Hero section of the book - by my count this is the third book in a row where one of the good guys is killed. \\n Surprisingly perhaps, given the emotional impact Rowling managed to put into the death of Sirius Black in the last book, the O.D.H here is just as poorly done as the rest of the book, and although you can easily conjecture ways in which the scene might make more sense and have a greater impact in light of the final book in the series, it\\'s very hard to care enough to try. Which is something of an achievement in itself when you\\'re talking about the death of a key and sympathetic character the reader has been following for five previous books. \\n Which leaves the mystery of just who is the Half-Blood Prince? Who cares? The solution in the end is a Pull-the-Never-Mentioned-Previously-Rabbit-Out-the-Hat affair that you couldn\\'t possibly have guessed given the available evidence, but it doesn\\'t matter because you won\\'t care. The character of the Half-Blood Prince, once revealed, is neither believable, nor interesting, nor even very necessary. It\\'s just more page-filler, saying in fifty thousand words what a good writer could have said in fifteen (not 15 thousand, just 15). \\n \\'Harry is tempted to cut corners and can be a little bit bad sometimes\\' - there you go, that\\'s only 14 and I\\'m not a writer of any description. \\n As someone recently mentioned on one of the mailing lists I frequent, the whole \\'Harry thinks Snape is up to no good, Ron and Hermoine aren\\'t sure, and Dumbledore isn\\'t saying\\' shtick is now well past its sell-by date and increasingly seems to be the only idea Rowling has for a Potter book. Here that idea reaches a potential conclusion and, frankly, I was bored stupid by just how lacklustre, lazy and badly done it all was., It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated. ..., Super Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, reread SOMETIME in 2007; originally read in 2005, Harry Potter has seen great evil, and defeated it time and time again. Now in his sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he\\'s about to face the greatest evil of all...puberty. In this installment of the series, Harry\\'s world suddenly becomes a lot more filled with thoughts of giggly girls and a preoccupation with who\\'s snogging who. It\\'s a wonderful break from the fight against Lord Voldemort and a reminder that the kids of this series really are just kids. However, the evil never really goes away and is always brewing at the back of Harry\\'s mind. As he and Dumbledore delve deeper into the man behind Lord Voldemort, Harry starts to wonder just what role he\\'ll play in the final battle between good and evil. \\n This is my first time re-reading (well listening, but whatever) this book and I had forgotten TONS of it! I mean, I remembered the basic plot, but I had forgotten some of the smaller details. I love Harry and Dumbledore\\'s relationship in this book. It\\'s very much like the relationship between a grandfather and grandson more than teacher and student. This is the book that made me love Albus Dumbledore. I\\'d always liked him, a lot even, in the earlier books, but in this one I really loved him. Of course, I\\'m sure JK Rowling did that on purpose, she\\'s dash clever that way. \\n This book had gotten too mixed up with the movie in my head. I didn\\'t actually like the movie, but having seen it much more recently, it was the version of the story that was more at the forefront of my imagination. Thankfully, it isn\\'t any more. The book is (as they always are) SO much better than the movie. I had forgotten how really truly devastating the whole end of Half Blood Prince is. I mean, okay, I remembered what happened, but again, I\\'d forgotten those little details that make is sooooo horribly wonderful. \\n I\\'ve started listening to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, so my August check in will be my last one for this challenge! I can\\'t believe I\\'m almost finished with the series, again! It\\'s almost as upsetting as it was the first time! I need there to be more Harry Potter...guess I\\'ll just have to start all over again when I finish., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Truly one of my favorites. This book is a great explanation, and shows a hint of how Harry falls in love....., I\\'m not a huge Harry Potter fan but they are always a fast read, despite the huge size!, I was duly warned about how dark these tales of our dear Harry get, and yet I\\'m as devastated as if these are actual people I know in real life! I feel like I want to quit everything and do nothing but read the \\'Deathly Hallows\\' and see if everyone gets what they deserve. ...., Rowling moves her characters to adulthood with this novel. Harry becomes more entwined with the tasks at hand. His instincts and beliefs are not listened to by Hermione and Ron but also by Dumbledore. By creating this distance Rowling shows Harry as becoming more self-reliant. There is a lot of conflict between friends and allies in this book. There are a lot of info dumps with the looking back on Voldemort\\'s life which is a lot of set up for the next novel. The first time reading these info dumps is good. This means there is less action in this book and more background. This slows the novel significantly but sets up the next novel nicely. If I could do half a star I would. Rowling created a wonderful novel which is almost over the top but didn\\'t quite hit the mark. I wonder if she could have found a more interesting way of doing the info dumps which would have pushed this to a solid five star read., I just reread this one for the 4th time, mostly because the movie is getting ready to come out and I am UBER excited. This is truly one of my favorites from Rowling\\'s series. I think the only one I like more is the Deathly Hollows. She\\'s a genius, and remember what you read, it\\'ll be helpful for the 7th and final book., Enjoyed a more leisurely second read of this beloved series. Still cry at the end., Dumbledore dies. There. I ruined it for you! muahahahahaha!, Just as great the second time around., Really, really awesome. These books are so extremely well written, and I love the fact that there are so many details that just keeps surprising you all the way through the story. \\n I don\\'t really know what to say, I just like these books a whole lot. \\n And I think the characters are awesome, especially Dobby and Luna Lovegood., Obviously AMAZING \\n Every single Harry Potter book is the most enjoyable thing ever., ** spoiler alert ** \\n 4 stars because Dumbledore died. Immature I know, but it was the first of the books to make me cry., I loved it!, Time for a re-read!!, Best of the series., This went on much better than the movie. A whole lot more explained., This one is DEFINTELY my favorite out of the whole series by far. I zoomed through it even with it being a fairly good sized book. I just had to keep reading and see what happened next. \\n My heart broke in the book, if you read it then you would know why. \\n The ending was beautiful and I can\\'t wait to read the last book!! \\n It was really interesting to see more about the past of Voldemort. \\n I LOVED IT!!, 80/100, Getting towards the end of my audiobook reread! I think I might have only read Books 6 & 7 once when they originally came out (as opposed to the multiple reads the others got before each release) so it\\'s been great revisiting them. Jim Dale is fantastic as always., excited for book 7, This is my favourite HP novel - it is brilliant. It has fantastic character interaction, deep plot and great writing. I was glued to every page. The only thing vaguely odd was Harry, chest monster, but I can forgive it that :)., I love the audiobooks. I cried when Dumbledore died, which I haven\\'t in a long time because after you see it so many times, you just get used to it. So much was left out that I loved revisiting. I loved seeing all of the memories, not just the few that you see in the movies. I love seeing how supportive Ron is. I love seeing Ginny. LOVE, if you like magic and adventure than you will like these books. but I would watch it on reading It to young children., stupid public holiday - now i have to wait until tuesday to get the last book! i can\\'t wait!, This book is definitely way better than the movie. The feeling of the truly Half Blood Prince which is neither Harry or Voldemort cannot be caught when you watch the movie. How we love seeing another side of Severus Snape., AMAZING AS ALL THE OTHER HARRY POTTER BOOKS ARE :D \\n WHTS NEW HERE?, *** Over due review*** \\n I\\'m putting up random dates because i can\\'t recall the exact date when I\\'v read this book. \\n Man this book was so intense that I kept forgetting to get back to real world LOL \\n It\\'s harry potter - come on its awesome, This was defintely the books that I enjoyed least in the series. I thought that there was too much stuff that didn\\'t deal with the main story but just helped round the characters even more. I like the characters but the new information provided wasn\\'t that important. Ending is tearful and I can\\'t wait to finish the next book., Becoming your typical right of passage story. Excited to see how it ends., F ROW bk.6 \\n Fantasy, Harry is in his sixth year at Hogswart and growing up. Lord Voldemort is attacking people, wizards and Muggles alike. Dumbledore has increased security at the school. He is injured with one hand black and withered. Draco Malfoy is up to something and Harry wants to know what. \\n This book gets off to a slower start than the previous ones in the series but each introductory chapter sets up the action in the rest of the book. Once it starts rolling along, the Hogswart Express would have trouble keeping up. \\n The book is tightly written. It keeps you wondering who the Half Blood Prince is until the end. Draco\\'s project is suitably diabolical. However this is not a stand alone volume. It must be read as part of the series or much of what happens will make no sense. \\n The series has grown darker, the stakes higher. This book is definitely young adult and older., Faster, richer, and more productive than the previous installments. Now finally we\\'re getting somewhere. \\n This one didn\\'t drone on and on about teenager problems as much as the past two books. While yes, there are some dating troubles that come out of nowhere, usually it\\'s quite funny and temporary, instead of dramatic -- I can mock the characters more easily for their halfwitted fumblings, and move on quickly to the real plot. \\n There are also many things recalled up from the past: places, names, and past events are actually acknowledged and used in the plot. Finally Rowling isn\\'t expanding her wizarding world as much as she is focused on using it to develop characters. \\n But Ron is still annoying as ever in this one. Some things never change. But at least something bad happens to him, that I could laugh at. Malfoy and Snape are left in the background for most of the book, and you don\\'t know what\\'s going on for months at a time. It\\'s simply tiresome that their mysterious situations are continuously brought up in Harry\\'s questioning mind, with no resolution until the end. Although I suppose you have to put the climax somewhere. And a lot of the dialogue toward the end felt very contrived -- as if Rowling suddenly had to get out a lot of information and just stuck it in anyone\\'s mouth. \\n But at least Dumbledore\\'s death made up for it! A large amount of annoyance can be made up for by the tragic and meaningful death of a main character. No good book is complete without killing off at least one person who is important. \\n But I liked this one the best so far -- now Voldemort actually becomes a realistic villain, with a past and a motive. He gets his own plot, so to speak, no longer just a scary mysterious force in the shadowy background. Finally Dumbledore actually talks to Harry about specifically what is going on with Voldemort. Finally some questions are answered. I just had to get through six books to reach it. \\n But Harry is still as obnoxious as ever in this one. Having hindsight about what\\'s really going on with Snape and Dumbledore shows to me just how much of a dunce he is. And even Dumbledore seems foolish and ignorant -- both he and Harry should have trusted and communicated with each other much more throughout all these years. Just ask each other! Tell each other what\\'s happening! You could save a lot of tears, time, and effort. \\n Also, now that I think about it, the whole situation with Ginny really bothers me. She\\'s not developed at all in any books leading up to this. In this book she\\'s forgotten again, until one day Harry realizes he likes her. Are you really that lazy, Rowling? Come on. Your main character sucks so much that you have to make his romantic interest sit stale and useless in the background, until your protagonist finally notices her for a bit, before dumping her again? I\\'m not even going to set this off as a spoiler, because it\\'s such a minor part of a much deeper story, and so insignificant for Harry and Ginny as characters. She sits there and takes Harry\\'s \"I\\'m so brave by myself\" moment, because it\\'s some subtextual, poignant relationship stuff? But there\\'s no foundation. Ginny is just another person Harry rejects as he goes off to try by himself, until he will ultimately screw up again and have to be bailed out. What a lame excuse for a romance. Why couldn\\'t it be deep and meaningful and have a foundation that\\'s actually been set up in the books before this? Or even in the beginning of this book! \\n Alright, on to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows!, Oh man. This one is much much better than I realised the first time I read it. Killer., Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: Who is the Half-Blood Prince? The answer will shock you as I know it did me! Will Harry\\'s shared connection with Voldemort be the death of him or can someone help him? All these burning questions!! Ah, I need answers, how about you? Read this book!, Harry returns for his 6th year at Hogwart\\'s School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and this year he gets to have private lessons with Professor Dumbledore. Friends Hermione and Ron try to guess what the esteemed Dumbledore might instruct, but to their surprise he is not teaching advanced defensive magic but taking Harry through the pensieve to view some memories of Voldemort before he became the most evil wizard who ever lived. \\n Snape is back and to everyone\\'s dismay has been made the instructor for Defense Against the Dark Arts. The new Potions instructor, Horace Slughorn, allows Harry and Ron to take his class and loans them old student textbooks, as they had not expected to be able to take the class and had not purchased them. \\n Dumbledore tasks Harry with retrieving a memory from Professor Slughorn, a memory he says is crucial to their research of Voldemort\\'s past. In order to do this, Harry uses a luck potion he won as a prize in Potions for producing the best potion of the day - much to Hermione\\'s disgust, and with the help of the Half Blood Prince, the student who used to own his potions textbook. He immediately takes the memory to Dumbledore and they work out after viewing that Voldemort learned how to split his soul into several pieces and places these pieces into protective horcruxes. \\n Slughorn\\'s memory and the knowledge that Voldemort created horcruxes lead Dumbledore to believe that there were seven in existence, two of which they have already destroyed - Harry destroyed one, Tom Riddle\\'s diary (Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets), and Dumbledore destroyed the other, a ring, resulting in the withering of his hand. Dumbledore believes three of the other Horcruxes are most likely a locket formerly owned by Salazar Slytherin, a relative of Voldemort\\'s and founder of Hogwarts; a cup formerly owned by Helga Hufflepuff; and Voldemort\\'s snake Nagini, who is never far from his side and possesses unusual attributes. Dumbledore thinks the last may be something that once belonged to Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, Gryffindor\\'s other founders. \\n Harry continues to have problems with Draco Malfoy, whom he is convinced has become a Death Eater and is working for Voldemort, even though Hermione and Ron think this is unlikely. Harry has been following Draco around school, or trying to, but there are strange times when Draco disappears, even from the map Harry has been using to get around school for the last few years. \\n Harry learns much from the Half Blood Prince and wonders who he could have been. Hermione doesn\\'t like Harry to use the book, feeling his advantage in class is unfair because he is not doing the work on his own. She also thinks whoever the Half Blood Prince was, he was not very nice, but Harry thinks she is just jealous because she is finally not the top in class. However, he has to admit that she may be right when he casts a spell on Draco that he got from the textbook. Not knowing what the spell would do, only that it was to be used on \"enemies,\" he is horrified when Draci suffers a serious injury. Snape manages to save the boy but demands that Harry give him the book. Not wanting to lose his book, he hides it in the Room of Requirement and gives Snape a different one. Snape does not believe Harry, and for his action against Draco gives him detentions that remove him from the Quidditch team for the rest of the year. \\n Harry also deals with his attraction to Ron\\'s sister Ginny, whom he has always considered a friend. After the last Quidditch match of the year, he spontaneously kisses Ginny, and they begin to date. \\n Dumbledore tells Harry he believes he has located one of the horcruxes and they go off to retrieve it. While there... well, I\\'ve given enough away. :) \\n As with the others, I became completely obsessed with this book and have read it several times. Totally recommended. \\n Again, I would not recommend this book to those who will find the subject of magic or the idea of wizards and witches offensive. The entire book is suffused in these fantasy topics and those folks may not be able to get past that and enjoy the entertainment aspect, or be able to understand the other messages presented., Sheesh, I\\'m traumatized! I\\'m used to reading rather sedate fiction, often dense and old, and I forget how intense books can be! This book actually gave me bad dreams towards the end. Several days were absorbed into the world of Hogwarts at war. The intensity reminded me of when I was kid and first read \"A Wrinkle In Time\" and was sucked into it for weeks, and could hardly remember who I was anymore (What? I\\'m not Meg?). It\\'s both fun and alarming to feel that sensation again. Now that I\\'m old and boring, I not sure my nerves can take it! Harry, I\\'m worried about you!, LOVEDD THISS BOOKK!! this is my favourite book out of the whole series by farr, when i was reading the series it was hard to choose my favourite book as they were all soo good but after reading this one, i can defiantly say that this ones my favourite!!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I think that this book was very well written. I just don\\'t understand how Dumbledore didnt know that Snape was bad, unless he knew all along. I havent read the Deathly Hallows yet, but I just started it so hopefully that last book will shed some light on me!, Harry Potter is surely a book for the ages! \\n It just gets better and better as the book wraps up to its end., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Okay... just to start this off I am a Hufflepuff and if you want to know what house you\\'re in officially go to this website https://www.pottermore.com/ \\n Okay let\\'s get on with this Muggles! \\n This story leads to the tragic death of Albus Dumbledore. Dun! Dun! DUN! \\n Harry is having a bit of a hard time at school. As in falling in love with Ginny but knowing Ron will hate him forever. As in Snape becoming a Defense against the Dark Arts teacher. As in knowing Draco Malfoy is up to something EVIL. \\n But knowing isn\\'t enough. No one at all believes him. And he knows Snape is helping Malfoy. Wait, I just noticed they call people by their last name a lot. These are the top three: Snape. Malfoy. Dumbledore. Anyway.......... \\n Ron starts dating Lavender Brown and started snogging. Hermione was, in search of better words, furious. She sent tons of birds to attack Ron. Later they are back together happily. (not Lavender.) Harry and Dumbledore go to destroy a horcrux but Dumbledore had to drink a horrid potion. And he was dying they had the horcrux went back. They came back to Hogwarts to see that there was the dark mark over Hogwarts and Snape killed Dumbledore. I am saying a lot of spoilers aren\\'t I? To sum it up, the horcrux was a fake. They had his funeral and Harry said that he next year instead of school, he would find the horcruxes., This book was also very good. Unlike the other Harry Potter books, this book wasnt very predictible towards the end, which was very sad i might add.Overall amazing book., This book was AMAZING! I absolutely loved it. It had so much mystery and buildup to the end of the series which I\\'m very apprehensive about because I\\'m scared of how it\\'s going to end. I definitely cried when Dumbledore died because I didn\\'t want to believe it and I didn\\'t think it\\'d happen but now I know it did but I still refuse to believe it even though I know I have to., Harry finally doesn\\'t have everyone and everybody doubting everything he says. Dumbledore takes him under his wing and serves as Harry\\'s mentor. Harry has suspicions about Malfoy and Snape. Snore. Just like every book, right? Nope! This time, he\\'s right (or so it seems). Absolutely loved the story, the character development, all of it., Jo Rowling is a fantastic storyteller. This cannot be disputed, unless you\\'re just dead-set on going against the norm, or something, I don\\'t know. \\n Anyway, Rowling has spent the last five books drawing out the characters that we can\\'t help but love, such as Harry, Hermione, all the Weasleys, Neville, and Luna, to name a few. But she spends this book humanizing the characters we thought we\\'d never like: Tom Riddle (aka Lord Voldemort) and Severus Snape. Despite the quickly-darkening undertones of the book, she still manages to keep parts of the book light-hearted, my personal favorite moments being Luna\\'s Quidditch commentary and, of course: \"Why are you worrying about You-Know-Who? You should be worrying about U-No-Poo! The constipation sensation that\\'s gripping the nation!\" \\n There\\'s really nothing more to say. I love Harry Potter. I\\'ve always loved Harry Potter. I will always love Harry Potter., Great Story. Can\\'t wait to read the next one. \\n We learn a lot more about Lord Voldmort\\'s background. \\n The overall storyline moves forward pretty well in regard to Harry, Dumbledore, Draco Malfoy and Snape., Sometimes it is easy and comforting to argue that there is a good side and an evil side in the world. It is easy to position Harry and Dumbledore as good, and to position Voldemort as evil. However, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince complicates this clear-cut, black-and-white perception, focusing on the gray area in between. Here we learn how Voldemort came to have a desire to inflict evil deeds upon the world, and we are left to wonder what he might have done had he experienced more goodness in his life at a young age. We also see Harry accidentally play around with some Dark Magic. In Book 6 the issue of good and evil is far more complex than meets the eye., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Everything was amazing as usual but......... *Spoiler Alert!!* \\n Dumbledore died., Uno de los libros con los que mas he sufrido, Another buku tuebel yang ngga jelas isinya apaan :p, Noooooooooooooooo. I\\'m heart broken and need a break before I can face deathly hallows! \\n Merged review: \\n Brilliant. I have loved this series is much, can\\'t wait for my kids to get a little older so I can reread them with them., I really enjoyed this book. I really liked how you learn so much about fumbled ore in this story. And how they are starting to recognize that Harry is an exceptional wizard and let him help in magical things outside the school! It\\'s about time! I can see how people became obsessed with this whole series and world!, Another fabulous addition to the Harry Potter world. This book, like the rest, delves into the life of Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived. The characters in this series are so well developed that you will fall in love with many of them. The world building is very dynamic and many people that read the books are waiting for their letter inviting them to Hogwarts (even those of us over the age requirement of 11.) I reread this series every 2-3 years. I assume that at some point they will grow old but it has been 15 years and I still love them with a fiery passion., I just finished this book tonight! I have absolutely enjoyed reading the books 1-5 of the Harry Potter series, and this book was no different. Now I am off to begin the final book, book 7. \\n This book has the most romance in the series thus far, including 7 kisses, talking about kissing, and a few emotional thoughts. \\n I\\'ve taken notes on this entire series, and if you would like to see any, contact me on messaging on Goodreads., This book finally usurped PRISONER OF AZKABAN as my favorite. Intense with fantastic character and relationship development, great background on Voldemort, and powerful ideas about love and family., No words could do this book, or this whole damn series, justice. Like... Oh My God. Mind = Blown. I just want to know what goes on in that ingenious mind of Rowling! How ever she was able to think up such a brilliant story is beyond me! I am stunned! And.. Yeah, heartbroken. I sobbed my freaking heart out while reading the last chapter. AHHHHH! It hurts just thinking about it! I literally dread finishing the HP series., \"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" \\n Holy crap. If I thought Order of the Phoenix had the most heartbreaking ending, well, this one just left me lying still and unable to speak for hours. I\\'m absolutely devastated and frightened of what\\'s going to happen next now that the person we all look up to is dead. \\n The thing about Dumbledore is that he seem to hold everything in place. As though everything is right in the world when he\\'s around. And seeing him vulnerable and weak was just painful and distressing. \\n I really enjoyed reading this one, it showed more of where Voldemort came from and it just has that evil vibe in it, making readers curl up in their seats like they belong to the wizarding world. What I noticed in this story is that it grows as Harry grows older. I love it. I really wish I hadn\\'t seen the movies before reading these :( But the experience is so much different and I still recommend reading them even if you\\'ve seen the movies a thousand times! \\n Definitely one my favourites, if not my favourite, in the series., A little pissed about this book., After accompanying the Hogwart\\'s students throughout their experiences for 2,689 pages, I could not help but become emotionally involved. \\n As the death toll mounted, I found myself experiencing the same sense of loss and frustration as the characters in the story did. Their enemy had become my enemy and I was as determined as they that Voldemort had to be stopped regardless of the cost., No words for this book, the last three books are the hardest to read., Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince......... OMG HERE WE GO! \\n ... What do I say? \\n As always, it\\'s a knock out of the park. This whole series is just a masterpiece. Somehow, even into the sixth book, I don\\'t feel bored with the story yet. I\\'d think that by now, I\\'d be bored with it. They follow the same pattern. Harry at home, eager for an adventure, gets the call to adventure, train ride to Hogwarts, first few classes, typically a new DADA teacher, in this one a new potions teacher, problems with Draco, Quidditch stuff, Christmas break, Harry gets more suspicious and tries to figure out what\\'s going on, big plot twist as the bad guy isn\\'t who you expected, school year finished, head home. \\n Somehow, though, the books are all enjoyable. I\\'ll add on top of that that I\\'ve seen the movies, and still pretty vividly remembered Half-Blood Prince and all the events that transpire. Sadly, this means of course that I knew the plot twists and turns. It was still enjoyable, though. \\n For some reason, maybe because I\\'ve been reading the books consecutively since December/January, I\\'m not chomping at the bit to read Deathly Hallows. Maybe it\\'s also the dread of being the last (main) Harry Potter novel. I\\'m still really curious to see exactly how Snape is presented in the final book - I know most of the plot twists, but I still need to see how it\\'s explained in the books. For instance, I think the movie doesn\\'t explain at all the origin of the name Half-Blood Prince. So I\\'m hoping the book explains some of the lingering questions I have about Snape. I\\'m also very curious to see how the final book is presented compared to the movie. Since they had to make two movies out of one book, I\\'m curious if they moved scenes around to sort of give each movie a beginning, middle and an end. \\n So! No question about this one. Five stars. I\\'m also beginning to regret my having given Chamber of Secrets the lone four star rating in the series (I think). Looking back at it now, although Chamber of Secrets seemed to be kind of ho-hum, it really does add many important things to the series. Ginny\\'s interest in Harry, more about the Ministry of Magic, hinting to Horcruxes, Tom Riddle\\'s diary, the name Tom Riddle, more about Harry speaking in the language of snakes, and so on. I don\\'t know, but that book just appeared to not really live up to its predecessor. But a LOT happens in a short amount of time. \\n But anyway, Half-Blood Prince. Five stars of course. The whole series is truly a masterpiece, and deserves every bit of acclaim it\\'s been given. I really hate the age we live in, it\\'s so full of stupid and evil people, and we have so few great leaders nowadays. No Martin Luther King\\'s, no Thomas Jefferson\\'s, no George Washington\\'s. A lot of our literature I think is over-rated, authors appealing to teenage girls who go crazy for fads. But despite it all, I do feel a measure of pride to know I live in the same time as J.K. Rowling. To think if in times gone by, you lived in the days of Austen or Dickens or Twain or Poe. But I can say I lived in the days of Rowling. That makes me feel a bit better about life. At least there is one great person in the world who I know walked the earth the same time as me. At least there was one significant addition to literature that happened in my lifetime. Sadly, it took me a couple decades before I caught onto it, but at least I finally got around to giving the series a genuine chance, and I\\'m real glad I did. If somehow you haven\\'t read the Harry Potter books yet, whatever your reason, quit being an idiot. You are really missing out on a masterpiece. You\\'re walking right by the freaking Mona Lisa and aren\\'t even stopping to give it a glance., My favorite series of books of all time. I have both the Hardcover and Audio CD (both US) versions of this entire collection. I LOVE Jim Dale\\'s audio narration. A superb collection. I periodically reread the entire series, simply because I never want to let the magic go! \\n Update: I was granted, through a good friend, a chance to listen to the UK version of this series, read by Stephen Fry (I know! How great is that!), but I still preferred the US version, read by Jim Dale. It was great to hear the different pronunciations of words as simple as \"ate\" - it sounded like \"et\"! However, I was expecting the terms like \"toilet\" to be replaced by \"Loo\", among other variations. Silly American! \\n As always, a great series! Absolutely my favorite! \\n Update: I was granted, through a good friend, a chance to listen to the UK version of this series, read by Stephen Fry (I know!

However, I was expecting the terms like \"toilet\" to be replaced by \"Loo\", among other variations. Silly American! \\n As always, a great series! Absolutely my favorite!, Argh! I cried all over again. #1 favorite of the series. \\n Something I hadn\\'t noticed before: Rowling\\'s fondness for the phrase \"at once.\", I was very bored at first, but ended up really enjoying this book. This book is the definition of sexual tension. It was killing me! I was very frustrated with the characters for reasons that I can\\'t say and the ending completely shattered me. I was crying and I was in school so you can imagine the looks I got. I would have enjoyed this much more if I hadn\\'t known who would die and who the Half-Blood Prince was. I was spoiled majorly and that really hindered my entire enjoyment of it. But it was still a fabulous installment in this series and I am looking forward to reading the final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows., Rereading aloud with Sam...we try to read a chapter every night., At last the woman starts to give some answers but it was also the first one to make me cry. I\\'m going to be a mess reading the last one..., For 5 books, Rowling was pushing us up a hill. With this book, she pushes us over the edge and we start the roll down the other side. Things are moving much faster, the stakes have become infinitely higher, and characters who once seemed merely mean or bad tempered have suddenly developed some very sharp teeth. Rowling has worked her hooks in deep and we are now powerless to do anything but read along breathlessly as she simultaneously breaks our hearts and tells us to continue to have faith., Plot- 9/10 \\n Characters- 9.5/10 \\n Writing- 9/10 \\n World Building- 9.5/10 \\n Total- 9.2/10 \\n Quickie Review- Another fantastic book in the Harry Potter series. The whining of Harry and his friends were not as frequent, and while you could tell they were still teenagers, it wasn\\'t irritating. More complex relationships formed, and the plot took a darker turn. The addition of the horcruxed made the plot interesting, what with the exclusion of quidditch and the Triwizarding Tournament. The climax was beautifully done, and while it was chaotic, it was controlled and well-executed, so I knew what was going on. This was also a turning point for Draco and his role in this series. He really took a strong position as an antagonist. As well, the twist with Snape at the end was unexpected and awesome. It set the stage for the last book., Mi favorito de la saga, This was the funniest book in the series for me but a lot of it was talking about old voldy, love harry potter, obviously! :D, ** spoiler alert ** \\n So you would think after all of these emotions and comments and everythings about being engaged my fiance and I would be glued together at the lips because we are obviously very much more in love than the rest of the people in the world who are simply dating. Or maybe it was because of these overwhelming emotions that caused him to simply say, \"Want to just read together for a while? I know you\\'ve been wanting to finish the sixth for a while now.\" \\n And that is yet another reason that caused me to realize, yes, I do not need to have minor panic attacks over whether or not this man is right for me because he accepts the fact that I am twenty-one years old and still reading Harry Potter. I remember the exact place I was sitting when I read Dumbledore\\'s death scene for the first time, and now I remember the second. The first time I was sitting on the edge of my bed, broke down in tears (partially because it was late into the night, and partially, of course, because Dumbledore just freaking died). The second time I was sitting in bed, next to you. You were reading that novel about the monks and the kidnapping, and I was reading about Malfoy having internal conflicts about good versus evil. The first time I read Dumbledore\\'s death scene, I was so overwhelmed that I skimmed the rest of the novel, because, quite frankly, it is just too much to go on. The second time I read Dumbledore\\'s death scene, I was so overwhelmed that I skimmed the rest of the novel, because, quite frankly, it was still just too much to go on. I put my head on his shoulder and sighed. He looked down at me. \"Dumbledore...he.... \" I whined. He smiled. \"Oh...\" he said, in that falsely sympathetic tone. \\n Not growing up with the series, he will never fully understand, but I appreciate the fact that he tries., I liked all of the last three, MAAAAAAAAAAAKE OUTS. \\n I know a lot of awesome stuff happened in this book, but really, I can\\'t get past Harry\\'s snark and the fact that everyone is constantly trying to make out with each other in this book. God, I love J. K. Rowling. She\\'s hilarious., Thoroughly enjoyed it! I can\\'t wait to read the last book in the series, but it will have to wait until I get some other stuff done! :) These books completely suck me in!, This is the sixth installment of Harry Potter in this series, where Harry Potter discovered a Potions book with scribbles from the Half-Blood Prince. The group tries to figure out who it is and it is not revealed until much later... Plus, the wizarding community is sort of lockdown as the Death Eaters are lurking about and there have been murders and hexing happening. On top of it, there some love in the air, as well as, sadness to the community. Good read!, I\\'m very upset, For some reason I never put the Harry Potter books on good reads, and now that I am revisiting them through the audio books, I thought I would review that. Jim Dale, the narrator, is fantastic! He really does a great job of every voice (well, my one quibble is the voice he does for Ginny, not a fan). Having read the books just when they first came out, it has been such a treat to listen to the stories and be reminded just how wonderful they are!, It goes without saying that the books are better than the movies. \\n It\\'s almost as if entering another world. I don\\'t know why I\\'d never read HBP before, especially as I\\'ve read all the rest but I must say, I was captivated from the go. I felt as if I was reading a completely new book, considering the plots and essential information that is ignored in the film. \\n I will always recommend that people read the books. This has managed to come second in my favourite Harry Potter\\'s behind the unbeatable PoA., I thought this book was as hard to put down as the previous book in the series. I\\'m glad I was able to start it on a Friday night so that I could spend lots of time reading it over the weekend. This next week is probably going to be frustrating, though. I\\'ll be anxious to read the last book but I won\\'t have nearly as much reading time as I would like during the work week. \\n I\\'m giving this book 5 stars for the same reason I gave the previous book 5 stars - because of how much it gripped me and took over my life, causing me to spend every spare moment possible reading it. But that doesn\\'t mean I like everything that happened in the book. \\n I really can\\'t write anything else that wouldn\\'t risk spoiling the fun (and in some cases torture) for anybody who still hasn\\'t read this series, so the rest is in spoiler tags. \\n Ok, I know I said in my last review that I wanted to see more of Dumbledore, and I was really happy that this book had so much of him in it. There were some really great moments between him and Harry. But I hated that he died! Of all of the characters Rowling could have killed off, he was the one that I least wanted to see die. It might be odd, but his death had more emotional impact on me than I think either Ron\\'s or Hermione\\'s would have if one of them got killed. \\n On the other hand, Dumbledore\\'s death didn\\'t take me completely by surprise. I\\'ve had this niggling worry since the very early books that he was doomed to die by the end. I can\\'t even really explain why. Maybe it\\'s just that the character type - kindly, wise, elderly mentors - don\\'t often seem to fare very well in fictional stories. I just kept hoping that I was wrong. I had thought it would happen in the last book if it happened at all, though. I can kind of see the point of doing it in this book, for the sake of Harry\\'s character growth since he is the main character after all. This forces him to be the one making the big decisions now. Harry won\\'t have Dumbledore\\'s wisdom to fall back on (even if he did ignore it way too often) or the safety and rescues he often provided. \\n There were some things that didn\\'t add up, though. I was always waffling about where Snape\\'s loyalties were. It\\'s hard to consider somebody to be one of the \"good guys\" when he holds onto his anger so steadfastly and when he treats people with such prejudice. Blaming Harry for his father\\'s behavior was unfair and irrational and, if he was really working against Voldemort, it seemed like he often put his own petty interests ahead of the good of the cause. So I was never 100% sure - was he as evil as he acted? Or was he a misguided and hateful person who was still genuinely working against Voldemort? Or was most of his behavior a big act to make certain Voldemort would believe he was still working for him even when he wasn\\'t? \\n I usually swung toward one of the last two explanations because Dumbledore trusted him and I couldn\\'t imagine Dumbledore being wrong. I know he wasn\\'t infallible, but I figured he had a really, really good reason for trusting Snape. Harry believed that Dumbledore was bamboozled by Snape\\'s apparent regret about leading to the death of Harry\\'s parents when Snape hated them to begin with. That doesn\\'t make sense to me because Dumbledore was definitely not a fool. He was wise enough to be cautious about Tom Riddle, so why would he be any less cautious with Snape who had undeniably been serving Voldemort? It just seems like there had to be more to Dumbledore\\'s belief that Snape could be trusted. \\n I also thought it was weird that Dumbledore said \"Please\" to Snape right at the end, as if he was asking him not to kill him. That\\'s how Harry interpreted it, anyway. If Dumbledore really had realized at that point that Snape wasn\\'t really on his side, I still don\\'t think he would have done anything remotely like beg for his life. It seemed wrong and completely out of character. \\n So I can\\'t help but hope there\\'s some sort of trick going on - that this was some sort of an elaborate ruse and things aren\\'t really as they appear. I know that\\'s really unlikely, though. We know that Harry apparently became unfrozen from his paralysis the moment Dumbledore died, and his phoenix Fawkes began mourning shortly after his death also. The characters all saw his dead body. And we saw Snape agree to the unbreakable promise that he would help Malfoy accomplish his objective which Malfoy made pretty clear was to kill Dumbledore. On the other hand, if Snape wasn\\'t really on Voldemort\\'s side, then he surely would have told Dumbledore about the plot and they would have had time to come up with something... but I\\'m probably overthinking it just because I didn\\'t want Dumbledore to die. \\n Ok, moving on! There was quite a bit of teenage romance angst in this book. More than I wanted, although at least the Harry/Cho thing seems to be well over with. I didn\\'t like Cho at all. Ginny is at least likeable. The Hermione/Ron thing got a little annoying, though. I don\\'t mind a relationship developing between the two of them, and it\\'s been obvious that was coming from early on, but the immature way they handled it got tiresome. I know, they\\'re teenagers and their behavior wasn\\'t abnormal, but I still didn\\'t really want to read about it. And I wanted to throw my Kindle across the room every time I read \"Won-Won\". Yech. \\n In response to my review of book 3 on BookLikes, there was a bit of discussion about the Time-Turners. So I thought it was worth pointing out that they were referred to again in this book. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are talking to Hagrid about why they didn\\'t sign up for his course this year and Hagrid suggests they could have \"applied for Time-Turners\" and Hermione tells Hagrid that they \"smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners\" when they were there. This seems to imply that there\\'s an application process by which people can request to use Time-Turners and that there are several of them. In book 3, it had seemed to me like Hermione was given a bizarrely unique experience by being allowed to use one, but this seems to indicate that it wasn\\'t unprecedented. There was also the tiniest hint of them in the previous book, but it wasn\\'t clear if Time-Turners were actually being referred to so I didn\\'t mention it in my last review. \\n I loved the first chapter in this book where we get to see the muggle Prime Minister learn about magic and interact with the \"other minister\". That was a very funny chapter and I enjoyed it even though I was anxious to get back to the main characters. Dumbledore\\'s interactions with Harry\\'s family a couple chapters later were hilarious too. \\n One more book to go!, I love this book. There\\'s not much else to say other than I love it and I really don\\'t want the series to end., now she\\'s (J.K. Rowling)back on the track, My feelings, I wish I could give six stars, because all the Harry Potter books deserve five when measured against other books, but when measured against each other, this one deserves more., exciting leaving you to wonder throughout who is the half blood prince?, This has been my least favorite in the series because the language disintegrates and there is an awful lot of making out--which in my opinion is not appropriate for the age of kids reading Harry Potter., I can\\'t. \\n I can\\'t. \\n I can\\'t. \\n I can\\'t. \\n I can\\'t. \\n I can\\'t. \\n I can\\'t., Rereading the series before going to universal., In my opinion this is by far the darkest and most grim Potter book. It is also my favorite in the series with Prisoner of Azkaban being my second favorite. The story line takes major point shifts and plot twists., 5/5 stars. At a loss for words, but, fortunately, I don\\'t need to even say anything. Everyone knows this is wonderful., Very,very good. Every book has just been amazing. This book also was very sad, made my heart break. Took me awhile since I got lazy with it but the ending is a real tear jerker and a page turner., 3/24/15 \\n This book blew me away. Many huge secrets that I\\'ve been wondering about for many books were revealed. The story gets much darker and the characters once again find themselves in terrible danger. It is such a delight to read about characters you love for this many books. It\\'s hard to say more without giving things away. I can\\'t wait to finish this series and see how it all ends up at the end. Oh man this is going to be a good read! \\n 9/19/17 \\n Man this book was a punch in the gut, even the second time around! So much emotion tied to these imaginary characters I\\'ve grown to love. This was a powerful book. I particularly loved the scenes where Harry and Dumbledore were together. Everything changes in this book. It is so sad. What an amazing read., Jim Dale Audio\\'s 2011: \\n If Book 5 had too much going on, I felt like this one was suddenly missing more than it had. I loved listening to it. The loyalties continue to be tested. The students, as well as the adults are pulled in every direction. \\n The mystery of Draco is handled so much less than I remember it being. And the pensive more. The importance of understanding beginnings grows from Book 5, where we were more immersed in Harry\\'s and we transition seriously into needing to understand all of Voldermort\\'s past as a human. \\n And yet the most important deciding scene for me on just what kind of people Snape and Dumbledore both are happened for me in this book, the first time it came out and again in here. Where I realized just how grey both their characters are, how right that is, and how much they would sacrifice themselves for the children each time., On rereading, I think this is my favorite of the series. Hogwarts as Hogwarts, older kids=more interesting, less of Harry charging around angry, plus OMG ROMANCE. \\n Not to mention that it\\'s really suspenseful and well-constructed. \\n My only problem is the ridiculous Spider-Man style \"We cannot be together because it is too dangerous for you!\" bullshit. I don\\'t believe it for a second., I couldn\\'t read the ending of the book without crying, thoroughly enjoyed it. Can\\'t wait to read the last book., The 6th book in the Harry Potter series is a great book to lead you up to the final book. Its slow at first but once you get in to it its picks right up. Long read not one of my favorite but a must read., I really loved this book, adored it, obsessed over it even. I read it very quickly as a result unfortunately. \\n This book is in stark contract to the lighter subject matter and tone of the others and that isn\\'t a bad thing at all, although I did miss the time when things used to be happy at points. \\n This book for me was unbelievably sad, in fact I drew out reading the closing pages as I remembered what was to come and when it did come, I felt very upset. But the mark of a good book is making a reader feel such strong emotions whether they be of happiness, sadness or dislike and therefore this is one of these great books. \\n Sadly now onto the last one and although I knew the series had to end, its unfortunate it did so. JKR could have wrote much more!, OMG OMG OMG THE ENDING!! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT... \\n Haha! Just kidding. While this book has been on the shelves for around 11 1/2 years (releases in July of 05), I know new kids are coming up and reading them. Adults that didn\\'t when they were younger are reading them so I couldn\\'t put a spoiler right at the beginning but like my other Harry reviews spoilers may pop up so I wouldn\\'t continue to read if I were you. Anyway...and yes this is more summery than review. Curse me. I just finished and I need to TYPE. \\n The penultimate chapter of the Harry Potter saga, the Half Blood Prince seeings Harry even more upset than he was at the start of Order of the Phoenix, having lost his godfather at the end of that adventure. He is depressed, sad, and missing Sirius desperately. He also feels completely out of touch as to what is going on as no one is saying anything for fear of it getting caught in the wrong hands. Understandably. You really do not know who is on what side, not really, even if you think you know do you really? \\n Luckily Harry is soon sent to the Burrow after helping convince Horace Slughorn to join the staff of Hogwarts. Harry thinks he is going to be their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher since that position has a new face every year. At the Burrow he learns that Bill and Fleur (from Goblet of Fire) are engage and to be wed the following year. Such happy news in otherwise dark times. \\n Harry suspects Malfoy is up to no good because, well, he is Malfoy. The young wizard runs off to Knockturn Alley and into the dark magic shop Harry had found himself in back in year two. Malfoy as usual is acting suspicious, setting off half of Harry\\'s motivations for much of the book. \\n At school, they learn Slughorn is now the potions teacher and Snape has finally earned the role he so desperately wanted, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. This is all much to our heroic trios dismay. Whatever Dumbledore and the other members of the Order may feel, they don\\'t trust him, Harry least of all. \\n Since Slughorn is now potions master, Harry and Ron are able to join his NEWT class, having earn the proper grade. Which begs the question...if a student failed most of their OWLs...what do they do when they go back to hogwarts? Just go to the 1 or 2 they passed? Repeat? Maybe they just don\\'t come back? Then again Crabbe and Goyle are back so I guess they do just repeat. \\n Anyway, in the NEWT level potions class, Harry manages to get his hands on a copy of the text that was owned by someone called \"The Half Blood Prince\" (ROLL CREDITS!). Having learned nothing from his previous adventures, Harry keeps the book and uses it to his advantage, gaining high praise and favor from Slughorn. Oh and earning himself a vial of liquid luck (to touch on the movie for a minute, the liquid luck scene is easily one of my favorites in the series). \\n Harry also has secret, private lessons with Dumbledore. Knowing he will tell anyway, Dumbledore says Harry is free to say what happens in their meetings to Ron and Hermione (Dumbledore ain\\'t dumb). Through the pensieve (AKA memory pool of silver goo), Harry is taken through key points in Voldemort\\'s life, seeing his parents, his life at the orphanage, his time at school, and after he left Hogwarts. Each memory provides more and more insight into the Dark Wizard Harry feels he has to fight because of the prophecy. Even after Dumbledore explains the prophecy is irrelevant. Voldemort made it come true and that even if Harry hadn\\'t heard what it was about, he still would\\'ve wanted to end Voldemort\\'s life due to all the pain he has caused young Harry. Again, Dumbledore ain\\'t dumb. \\n In one of the memories, we learn about Horcruxes. Well we almost do. The memory was tampered with and Dumbledore puts it on Harry to get the real memory from Slughorn, the reluctant witness. \\n Harry is otherwise distracted by not just school and Quidditch but by following Malfoy. Katie Bell (a teammate of his) and Ron are both cursed by dark magic. While both survive, Harry is sure Malfoy is behind it and that his intent was to kill. Since Slughorn won\\'t provide the memory willingly, Harry focuses his attention on Malfoy, sure he is using the room of requirement to do whatever is he is doing. \\n Pressured heavily by Dumbledore, Harry finally does manage to get the memory from Slughorn by using the vial of \\'liquid luck\\'. (AGAIN, love this scene in the movie) Essentially, he got Slughorn drunk at Aragog\\'s (the big spider from Chamber of Secrets) funeral and convinced him that he needed to give up the memory. \\n The memory does provide a bit more insight into horcruxes. You kill someone and put a bit of your soul into an object or thing. Say...a diary or your father\\'s ring. What this means is, you can\\'t be completely killed, not while part of your soul is trapped in an object. Voldemort wanted to live forever and he found a way. An evil and dark way. Also kind of sad. Imagine having part of your soul trapped in a spoon for all eternity. \\n These lessons also show Harry why the DADA\\'s position is cursed. Voldemort wanted it. Dumbledore, not be dumb, said no. Could you imagine Voldemort teaching? He would have a ready made army of hundreds all too soon. Since saying no, Dumbledore had been unable to find anyone to hold the position for more than year. This almost brought out a bit of a continuity error from book one as the way Hagrid introduces Quirrell, it seems as though he has held that role for a while but while Quirrell had been at the school for a few years, Harry\\'s first year at Hogwarts was his first year teaching DADA (it isn\\'t directly said in the books but was later cleared up by Rowling and as she is the Goddess of all things Harry Potter, her word is gold). \\n Dumbledore finds the location of one of the horcruxes and he takes Harry on a journey to get it. It one of the more difficult parts of the book (at least for me), Harry forces a potion down Dumbledore\\'s throat at his request in order for them to claim the horcrux. They nearly get killed by some zombie like creatures but manage to escape back to the village just outside the school where they see a dark mark in the sky so they fly back to the school. \\n And here the shit hits the fan. Draco, under orders of Voldemort, is supposed to kill Dumbledore but he can\\'t (Harry even ends up feeling bad for him after this if that says anything) so what happens? Snape does it. Snape. Kills. Dumbledore. \\n The world shattered when they read that, when word got out to those who hadn\\'t finished the book yet. I still remember it clearly. Everyone was cursing Snape\\'s name (and the name of the guy who drove by people in line just after midnight and shouted \"SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE\" out his car window). At least a first. A few theories cropped up later about what side Snape was actually one, leading to some to not quite want to see Harry kill him in the next book (except that guy in the car. Fuck that guy. Harry can kill him.) But that first night and day, everyone hated Snape just like Harry did. He wasn\\'t on the good side after all. He was always on the side of Voldemort. \\n Other things that happened: Tonks wants to be with Lupin (he eventually gives in), Ron made out with Lavender Brown to piss off Hermione. Hermione pretended to like some guy who\\'s name i can\\'t be bothered to look up right now. And oh...Harry kissed Ginny. Right in the common room. After Gryffindor had won the Quidditch cup again. In front of Ron. \\n Harry isn\\'t going back to Hogwarts. He wants to find the last 4 horcruxes to defeat Voldemort. He wants to kill Snape too for obvious reasons. \\n Overall, a great read. So much happens that needed to happen to bring us to the final showdown in the next book (which I\\'m sad to say I only read once. I know I\\'m horrible). Harry learns a lot more about Voldemort. Probably more than he wanted to know but what he needed to know. Sometimes knowing the motivations behind someone\\'s behavior is helpful in knowing how to defeat him. Voldemort wanted to be the most powerful, he wanted to hurt people from a young age. Of course he would hide his soul into objects that did not belong to him. Of course he would be arrogant enough to believe that putting his soul into 6 other places would give him power beyond measure. But he is still human..sort of. Well he was at some point. Now he\\'s a giant dickhead with a lot of power like our president. But he can be defeated. Harry knows how. He just has to learn to trust in his friends and in himself., This is my favorite book in the Harry Potter franchise. New mysteries were added, the suspense really kicked up a notch, and we saw new insights into familiar characters. The writing flowed smoothly, and the story progressed at a very reasonable pace., Snape mata a Dumbledore. \\n Y los dos son awesome., Brilliant!Clever!Well Written and Heartbreaking! Just a few words to discribe this Absolutly wonderful book! Once again J.K. Rowling has yet to fail me! Excited to start thr final one!!!, Harry Potter and the Dumbledore is Never Straightforward About Anything, Ever. \\n Also Harry Potter and the It\\'s Not Who You Think It Is, Harry, Part 2., I\\'m internally sobbingdY~. Now to watch the movie and sob even more., This book definitely did not hold the same shock factor for me in this reading that it did 6 years ago. Knowing what\\'s coming helped me actually focus more on the story instead of worrying about what may or may not happen. On the heels of Book 5 when Harry lost Sirius, I was dreading finding out who Harry would lose next. If Rowling could kill off Harry\\'s godfather, then nobody was safe. Having grown up without his parents, unfortunately, Harry has become accustomed to losing the people he loves. After a long summer at the Dursley\\'s, Harry is collected from Privet Drive by none other than Professor Dumbledore who takes Harry on an excursion to contact an old colleague and then escort him to the Burrow. \\n Harry, Ron and Hermione finally receive their long anticipated O.W.L. exam results and Harry finds himself in an advanced Potions class with a new professor, Horace Slughorn. Potions have never been Harry\\'s favorite class, especially when Snape was the instructor. Harry acquires a potions book that belonged to someone calling himself the \"Half-Blood Prince\" and following the notes and tips provided within the book by the previous owner, Harry outperforms Hermione. \\n Harry is convinced that Draco is up to something sinister and spends a lot of time trying to figure out what it is. There are a few occurrences of students being cursed by unknown perpetrators that add to the suspense of the story. I enjoyed that Harry is made Captain of the Quidditch team and puts together a team that will hopefully win the House Cup. \\n The best part of the book, for me, are the private lessons Harry has with Professor Dumbledore where he learns what Dumbledore already knows about Voldemort\\'s early years and family. Through Dumbledore\\'s memories, Harry witnesses Dumbledore\\'s first meeting with the boy would become the most evil wizard of all time. Harry is also tasked with finding out the true memories of one of the professors that had been tampered with. Harry has his work cut out for him in this installment and as with the whole series, I enjoyed every minute of it., My least favorite so far but still great., The foreshadowing in these books is completely unreal., all the feels..., I\\'ve never read the Harry Potter books. I started reading the first one, but then got side-tracked onto another book. I\\'ve seen all the movies though and like them very much. \\n I just recently watched the Half-Blood Prince and I felt that so far, this was easily my favorite of all the films. I decided I just have to know what happens now. So I borrowed the last two from a friend and figured that I would read them, and then once finished, I\\'d go back and start at the beginning. Not the best way to do it, I know.. but that is what I\\'m currently doing., Re-read as audiobook. \\n Oh the emotions! All of the emotions. The time that Harry and Dumbledore spend together is so interesting and also makes the ending hurt so much worse., In the end accounting, I think this is my favorite of the books. Less whiny than the book before, and tighter. But long enough for details that I savored., My heart is broken all over again., I remember the title being released before the book came out. Who IS this half-blood prince?! The question that occupied my mind during math class. Of the series, this book had the most mystery., What more can I say than I love these books. I\\'m reading it so I can go to the movie., J. K. -- you\\'ve devastated me. Hope you\\'re happy., By this point of the series I hated Harry Potter and sided with Severus Snapes view of the boy. All the teenage drama while apt for the age group was irritating. I felt that the coupling also while realistic in people\\'s abilities to make poor partner decisions (personal opinion), it just felt too much like fan service. \\n As for plot...well it was basically the set up for the final book. Though a lot of stuff appears to happen, the plot has next to nothing to do with moving the story forward. Overall it\\'s a slow year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry., I actually like this more than the fifth now., Shit just got real. Starting the next book right now., better than other books till now in the series but still behind order of phoenix, I just finished reading this. I\\'ve already read it a few times, but with the movie coming out on dvd i couldn\\'t help not having another excuse to read it. All through the book, i cant help but think about what\\'s to come. I hate Harry\\'s hate for Snape, but i understand it completely. Snape is so harsh but because of the next book i can\\'t help but like him. If only Harry knew..., I re-read this after many years it came out. Being a Potter Fan, I realized that the wait for every book made me greedy in reading them, and I lost track of many details that are actually important for the whole plot. So it was nice to read it again, taking much attention to details, savoring the story. Maybe the fact I read it before helped me to understand some things (the fact that I remember, more or less, what is happening then, helps me a lot I guess ;)). It is always a good exercise for vocabulary if you\\'re not English mother tongue. And, anyway, these books always put me in that fantasy world I loved so much from the first book ;) \\n It is maybe one of the books with less action and more details. I enjoyed it much, as the old characters are \"identified\" somehow, many things we did not know about them come out. Let\\'s say it is a big millstone to approach the end of the saga, so I liked it really much!, Jk Rowling tiene un talento para hacerme llorar..., A re-read. Way, way, waaaay better than I remembered! Rowling\\'s achievement still staggers me., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Dammit. Knew it was gonna happen. Bawled anyway., Ooof. Heavy end. Good set-up for the end, though., Io amo il mondo di Harry Potter. Non c\\'e altro da dire., The magical world from Harry Potter fascinates me. I always wanted to know what happens next. I\\'m a huge fan of these books. \\n Definitely a must-read!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I remember very clearly the day this book was released, for several reasons, the calander I had been counting down upon for a year prior to the release finally had the day crossed off and of course I was able to wait in line for over four hours to get my copy. It seems that neither of these important moments in my life were wasted, I look back now as an avid reader of the Harry Potter Series in amazement that anything could have inspired such a pashion in my heart that would lead me to do any of those things, but it did, and I can say gladly that I was not disapointed. \\n I can say through reading this I became more interested in the character Tom Riddle, who is also often and commonly refered to as Lord Voldemort. It reveals his childhood and youth and gives explaination as to why it is that he has lived the life he has, and if that is not fascinating enough we learn of an even darker plot - The Horcruxes. This interesting plot which is introduced in this book provides the reader with something to expect from the next book, but I was left wanting more information as to the perculiarties behind such objects however I have been informed that it is terrible indeed by a website that said an editor felt physically ill after being told. (Whether or not this is true I am most interesting in finding out for myself!) \\n What else do we learn from this book, that indeed is an interesting question. Clearly this book is the most informative of the series, containing many of the important facts that we have always wanted to know such as the mystery of Voldemorts childhood, it is rather interesting to picture Voldemort as an attractive teenager or child, however we learn that he was not always the same in appearance as he becomes. We also learn some rather interesting information regarding none other than Severus Snape. I often liked to think of him as just a shady character who was simply misunderstood however we see another side entirely within the first few chapters of the book. \\n We also have the interesting addition of Horace Slughorn a particularly interesting character of whom Professor Dumbledore requires a memory from, it is this memory that holds the fate of the world practically with what it shows. This mission is later entrusted to Harry after Slughorn takes an immediate liking to him due to his fame and popularlity. We also get an insight into the romances forming at Hogwarts, and how these affect the relationships between other characters. \\n Overall, this book provides something so very different to the others, it creates deeper connections between the previous books and allows us to understand the choices and events that occur around the main characters, a word of warning, this book contains rather dark themes at times particularly those surrounding the Horcruxes. My suggestion that is not suitable to the very young of readers unless they can understand. But other than this it is worth a read, trust me if your like me you\\'ll appreciate the interesting insights into the characters that we don\\'t so often get to see. An excellent book. \\n 5 Stars., Best Harry Potter book so far. Loved it., Really enjoyed the entire series., ** spoiler alert ** \\n This and the next one are definitely my favorites! I sobbed, laughed, and loved every page. I loved seeing my favorite couples express their feelings for each other. There was so much foreshadowing and I LOVE IT. Jo Rowling is such an amazing writer. But in this installment we see Harry go through more pain with the loss of his favorite professor and that makes my heart really sad. Just like the last book, Hermione kind of nags too much, but I understand why. I really really enjoyed this one as I read it in less than 3 weeks, which is pretty good for a 650 page book. I also just want to say that Professor McGonagall is one of my favorite characters and is truly underrated. I truly cannot express how much this series means to me., Can I give this 6 stars?, One of my favorites in this series, it gave an interesting plot twist to it! Awesome read!, I can read this series over and over again, and I will never be bored. Long live HP!, My poor heart. I can\\'t even imagine what the next book is going to be like., Excepcional como todos los demas. Muchos giros,mucha intriga y una trama extraordinaria. No puedo decir mucho mas solo que este libro te ayuda aclarar muchas cosas,amar a unos personajes y a odiar a otros con todo tu corazon., A. and I did a combination of reading this and listening to the audio book together. obviously a reread, I\\'m not sure whether this one or the deathly hallows was my favorite Harry Potter book, all I remember was that I was so freaking mad when Dumbledore died., I cried in this book near the end. Be prepared for an emotional journey, I\\'m just a lot not okay... \\n This book was fantastic. A lot of relational developments and naturally development to the over arching plot. This book was so fast paced and so eventful I can\\'t really believe I\\'m done with it already. \\n It doesn\\'t quite compare to The Order of the Phoenix but it tops all the others before it. I can\\'t believe I\\'ve come this far in the series and how emotionally involved I am in these books. \\n The ending left the most bitter taste in my mouth for I too felt betrayed and horrified by the events that occurred. \\n Ugh I am too emotionally damaged and drained to say anymore., First read August 2011, It astonished me to realize that after all these times, I haven\\'t reviewed any Harry Potter books yet. I\\'ve read the whole series twice, and listened to the audiobooks twice: this is my third time listening to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. \\n I wouldn\\'t say much about the plots here as I have no intention to spoil anyone, but I\\'m just gonna express my feelings instead. This installment usually receives a relatively low preference from readers due to various reasons, but to me, it is arguably one of my most favorite books in the series. Having watched the movies before reading the books, I craved for new scenes that didn\\'t make it to the movies, and this book answered my call beautifully. From it, I learned the history of Lord Voldemort more detailed than what I received from the movie, the intensity of the unexpected situations in the end of the book: how vividly the scenes were described, and what kind of emotions each character possessed. \\n Since the series was introduced to me, I have always known where to seek the comfort when I need one. Whether I went through multiple surgeries, was under the effect pain-killer or dizziness, had a terrible stomachache, or lived through a day which nothing seemed to go right, the Wizarding World provides me something indescribable that nothing else can. Perhaps, it\\'s partly because the urge of wanting to go on adventure persists even though my body could lead nowhere. \\n Sensationally magical., Comment: benar-benar fantastis dengan segala imajinasinya yang sangat luar biasa, belum lagi istilah-istilah yang digunakan dalam bahasa sihir, bener-bener brilian! Cerita petualangan yang sangat hebat, lucu dan juga menegangkan, sama sekali nggak bisa berhenti (walaupun sejenak) untuk membacanya sampai akhir! Dan ini terjadi pada semua bukunya, dari 1 sampai 7!, The entire book is relatively light until one gets to the heart-wrenching last chapters. I\\'m still in shock. And thankful I read this only now and don\\'t have to wait 2 years for the next and final book., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I didn\\'t like how the normally jovially Ron Weasley was annoyed all the time in this book. Alot more history than adventure. I know that at the end everything came together but Harry\\'s obsession with Draco was just a bit much, even though I held my breath each time! \\n Now I\\'m reading this book a few years after it\\'s come out so I knew that Dumbledore does die but it didn\\'t make it any less sad. I felt like all the characters with what happens to Hogwart\\'s and Harry. On to Book 7., My second favorite in the series and a great way to prepare you for the deathly hallows., This book has some of my favorite scenes, most of which aren\\'t in the movie, so it\\'s always great to reread it., Heavier and darker and the kids are as captivated as ever. They are resigned that from here on out, there will be snogging., Sinceramente no puedo describir como me hizo sentir este libro, primero esta el echo que les mencione anteriormente que este libro esta al nivel de Twilight para mi, es decir, que ha causado en mi lo mismo que Twilight, me he compenetrado demasiado con Harry como lo hice en su momento con Isabella Swan. \\n Adicional a eso Rowling tiene una manera de escribir tan ordenada y tal magistral que verdaderamente se disfruta leyendo un libro como este. \\n Los personajes maduraron de una manera espectacular, Harry, Ron, Hermione y Ginny; es mas saben que les voy a contar las caracteristicas de cada personaje que me gusto: \\n * \\n Harry: este fue el cambio mas grande de todos los personajes, en los primeros libros senti que Harry era un personaje sin fuerza, pero la verdad es que era un nino abrumado con tantas cosas grandes; luego en el 3 y 4 libro lo vemos con un poco mas de personalidad y sobre todo en el cuarto donde le atrae Cho, luego el quinto definitivamente lo vemos mucho mas molesto con todo el mundo aunque la verdad es que se entiende, son demasiadas emociones para el chico, pero en este 6 libro lo vimos tan pero tan diferente, maduro, dispuesto a enfrentar lo que viniera encima, confia en sus amigos y sabe que pase lo que pase ellos son su mas preciado tesoro. Todo esto sin mencionar el factor \"GINYY\" que por supuesto que me encanto que esten juntos pues Ginny tambien es un personaje con mucha fuerza.. \\n * \\n Ron: este chico me sorprendio muchisimo, yo pense que al final se quedaria torpe pero no fue asi, no puedo decir que es totalmente maduro pues es incapaz de reconocer sus sentimientos hacia Hermione, sin embargo puedo decir que siempre fue un buen amigo. \\n * \\n Hermione: Esta es la mejor amiga que todos deseariamos tener, dispuesta siempre a estar hay cuando mas lo necesitas y dispuesta a ser sincera sin temor a herirte, en este libro para mi su mayor diferencia fue que era mucho mas sensible a Ron, hasta Harry lo notaba, el desde un principio se fue haciendo la idea de que al final terminarian juntos. \\n En fin, mejor no continuo porque entonces les relato todo el libro...solo tengo que agregar que lamento mucho no haber leido la saga antes y haber crecido con ella como lo han echo miles y miles de fans!, I think Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is an awesome book that I really loved. I think people who enjoy books about wizards and other people with special powers would like this book because it is about wizards who live in a casell and the adventures they have., True story: I saw my coworker reading HBP. I decided to strike up a conversation with her about it. I asked her how far along she was in the book. Her response: \"I\\'m only on book 6 because that\\'s all thats out.\", THIS BOOK. THE FEELS. THESE TEARS. MY HEART. \\n The plot turned even more intriguing. In this book, Hogwarts is not as safe as it used to be. The deeply-felt emotions of the characters propel action. Harry couldn\\'t help but notice that some of them are mysteriously up to something. Dumbledore, and Malfoy especially. \\n * * * \\n I LOVED READING EVERY BIT OF THIS BOOK!!! The twists and turns of the plot, no matter how heart-wrenching a lot of them have been, gets me every time. \\n The part in the beginning where Arthur and Molly Weasley exchanged questions as a precaution to make sure they were not Death Eaters was beyond adorable. \\n * * * \\n This is also the book where I realized that Draco Malfoy is not a boy who made bad choices -- He just never had a choice. \\n * * * \\n \"Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy.\" \\n WHOOP THERE IT IS. DRARRY is real. \\n Even after their Sectumsempra encounter, I still ship Draco and Harry. The tension between them is palpable. \\n * * * \\n \"It\\'s okay, we can fix it,\" said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand. \\n \"I love you, Hermione,\" said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily. \\n Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, \"Don\\'t let Lavender hear you saying that.\" \\n WAAAAAAAHHH FANGIRL MOMENT. This is the first time Ron finally said \"I love you.\" to Hermione. I ship them so hard. ROMIONE. \\n * * * \\n Half-Blood Prince = Severus Snape \\n Professor Snape finally got to teach Defense Against the Darks Arts in this book. He is absolutely one of my favorite characters. Like Draco Malfoy, he\\'s also in a fix. He didn\\'t have a choice but to follow what Narcissa Malfoy and Professor Dumbledore asked of him. \\n * * * \\n \"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" \\n -- Albus Dumbledore \\n Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is a character revered by a great number of people. He is certainly one of my personal favorites. I was so heartbroken when I first watched how he died in the movie. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I still couldn\\'t help but be sad all over again after reading it. \\n Reading this book made me feel all kinds of feels. Both the book and the movie has a dreary vibe (in terms of color, background, and atmosphere.) Another excellent read., And again, this book was a gift. The whole series, to this point, is completely satisfying for me. It might not be perfect, it might have a lot of plotholes or a too large gap of logic, whatever people decide to find to determine that these books are not \"literature\". It is fun, and beautiful, and a gift. I don\\'t think I\\'m ready for the last one., This is still a solid series in my book, but I don\\'t appreciate my favorite character, Snape, becoming a villan all of a sudden. Like Dumbledore, I trust him implicitly. \\n A word about the writing style: I\\'ve been trying to overlook it, but the Harry Potter series must break some of record for the overuse of adverbs. Some day I may go through it and cross all of them out, swiftly, mercilessly and deliberately., Amazing book! I love reading about harry and the rest of the magical world! \\n Though this book is a little darker, our characters are a little older and I am enjoying the transition from childhood to adulthood. \\n This book was also tremendously sad in the end, I am very saddened, even though I knew it would happen, it still bothered me. \\n I also see Snape in a much different light in the books. In the movie I liked Snape, I knew he was good, but he is a complete nit in the books lol!, I am reading it in Portuguese so it\\'s verrrry slow going., ES PERFECTO. El mejor libro de la saga, lejos!, Really emotional., loved them all, My memory is a little sketchy but I remember this book causing a lot of heartache to friends of mine who were used to Harry Potter. The reason was the death of one of the principal characters. At the point when this book was released, I had rather high handedly dismissed this series as children\\'s literature ! But now that I have finished it, I must say that Ms.Rowling does know how to deliver to her audience. A most charming book & without knowing the last one in the series, I rate this as my favorite in the series. \\n This work, in the order of things undoubtedly serves as the buildup to the climatic showdown between good and evil. It would have been undoubtedly easy and tempting for the author to make this a call-to-arms tale and with the murder of Dumbledore, it would have been an easy trick to pull off. I was rather amused by the way Rowling still managed to put in love, coming-of-age & a lot of teenager\\'s angst into the tale without making it awkward even one bit. Also, with Dumbledore out of the equation the playing field is much more level. \\n It\\'s finally time for Mr. Potter v/s Voldemort !, I grew up with this series, i love this series, i have read and re-read this series, i will probably re-read it multiple more times in the future. I recommend it to anyone, and i mean anyone. If you have not read this series yet, do so as soon as possible. You will not regret it., I don\\'t want to move on, it\\'s just hard to believe, ONE more book and it\\'s OVER! why??????????? \\n I love this series and I can\\'t believe it\\'s almost going to come to an end. The character development is great and I can\\'t say how amazing this world that Rowling created is., Unexpected finale, great story about Snape. Harry as a captain. This book is a top of the whole Harry Potter\\'s books because of the Snape\\'s story. Thanks for this Joanne :), My heart, my feelings..., excellent because we finally get a good look into voldemort\\'s backstory here. although rowling starts to introduce so many new ideas and elements, it\\'s pretty mind-boggling to think that she has to wrap all this up in book 7. \\n i may have been the only person in the world who was not THAT upset by the death at the end. i was more affected (oh let\\'s face it, i still am!) by the death in book 5., the best book in the series, Sigh.... I just love Harry Potter. <3, My favorite book in the series and incidentally it\\'s also the first one I read, and got me into reading in the first place., Broke my heart. :(, I hate the part when dumbledore dies... but makes the foundation for the next book., Well, I didn\\'t quite finish this in one day, but I came close. Went to the downtown Borders & waited in line at midnight for the first release. Stopped reading around 2 a.m. and then started again as soon as I woke up., Rereading HP books at the age of 22. Still equally awesome., Dark and mature Harry grows with the reader moving into the darker finale., Ineloquent, but sufficient: OMFG!, OH MY \\n I have 19 day to finish the Harry Potter series \\n CHALLENGE ACCPETED, So, back when this came out (10 years ago!?!?!?!?!) I pretty much despised this book... mainly for the teen angst surrounding Ron/Hermione/Lavender and Ginny/Harry. As a result, prior to my re-reading this week, I had read this book fewer times than any of the others (2). It has been AT LEAST 5 years, and I have to say, my perspective has changed a lot. Don\\'t get me wrong, the teen drama still drives me crazy, but I now appreciate this book for everything else it has to offer. This book, more than any of the others, ties together everything leading up prior. Where as any of the first 4 books I think you could read in isolation, this one you need all of the background knowledge, all of the little hints and clues and plot lines from the first 5 to understand. And in that way, this book is awesome. I\\'m no longer sure this book is at the bottom of my favorite to least HP list anymore..., Another good Harry Potter, but not as good as the previous ones. O.K. Book number 7 to go!, I... I..I.. don\\'t know how to describe this book. Just that I can assure you, it will be worth your time and tears., Ugh. I don\\'t even know what to say. It\\'s got to be impossible to spoil a book that has been out for almost 20 years and has been made into a film, right? \\n I thought Order of the Phoenix was my favorite but this one might be it. Everyone has to grow up and residents of Hogwart\\'s aren\\'t an exception. This was a gripping and fantastic read, including all the punches in the feels. Lovely and amazing., This is another one of those books that mean so much to me. ALL of the Harry Potter books I consider comfort reads and I can really only tell you exactly what I enjoy about them. This book ALWAYS makes me sob like a child, the ending..which I won\\'t giveaway always makes me cry but I love that books can draw that kind of emotion out of me. I savor that in a good book. \\n Plot wise this book sets the stage and scene for the next, and final, book in the series. You get to see a lot of the basics of how Voldemort became who he was and you get a feel for how Harry Potter is going to play out in the grand scheme of things. I love this book even more because Snape is one of my favorite characters., Sexta entrega de la ya mas que famosa saga de Harry Potter. \\n Personajes mas desarrollados, trama mas seria y oscura, mayor intriga... Todo esto y mucho mas es lo que nos encontramos en las paginas de esta historia. \\n En esta ocasion la oscuridad se cierne sobre Londres. Y ya no solo en la comunidad magica, sino que los muggles corren serio peligro. Se desencadenan multitud de \"accidentes\" que tienen que ver con quien-vosotros-ya-sabeis y su entorno. \\n Harry ya sabe que vaticino en aquella taberna la profesora de adivinacion y esta dispuesto a superar los obstaculos que sean necesarios para cumplir su cometido. Cuenta para ello con la sabiduria y el gran poder del mago mas impresionante de todos los tiempos, Albus Dumbledore. Ambos se enfrascaran en una serie de recuerdos para comprender mejor a su enemigo y estar mas preparados para el gran momento. Sin embargo no va ser un camino de rosas. \\n Este libro me ha gustado mucho, pues la intriga bajo mi punto de vista se mantiene durante gran parte de la novela, creando esa necesidad de avanzar por la misma que tanto me gusta. Los personajes como ya he dicho se ven mas maduros y complejos y la trama en si se torna aun mas tenebrosa. \\n El final fue !DIOS! No me lo esperaba para nada (sin contar con algun spoiler), y me dejo sumamente intrigado ya que hay muchas cosas por resolver en Las reliquias de la Muerte (7deg y ultimo libro). Tengo muchas ganas de acabar pero a la vez quiero alargar la historia porque me da lastima concluirla., This one keeps you wondering about who is the half blood prince. I cried and cried at the end of this one even though I knew the ending was inevitable., My absolute favorite book of all time and possibly the best book ever written ( or 1 of 7 anyway). I am very deffendant of my Harry Potter books, and if you get to close I may have to kill you. See, I am probably the world\\'s biggest harry Potter fan, and know EVERYTHING about it. I LOVE HP! :), I am absolutely in love with the entire Harry Potter series; I think J.K. Rowling is a genius; I want very badly to have been a student at Hogwarts and housed in Ravenclaw; I secretly admire Bellatrix Lestrange even though I do not mourn her defeat; When I finished the 7th book, I felt like a stage of my life had ended; I have numerous other declarations of my love of these books but I won\\'t bore you. \\n I stayed up until 3:00 a.m. with a full day of 13-14 years olds awaiting me to finish this book and when I read of Dumbledore\\'s demise, I threw the book across the room and sobbed angrily cursing not only the author but anyone (and their relatives) who\\'d suggested I read these books. My recovery from this grief was slow in coming but I was just beginning to heal (with an intricate theory about Dumbledore not really being dead) by the time book 7 landed into my feverish hands., One of my favorites. I just finished it...again. I have issues., Re-read 9/14/16: This book was great again. I love it! I\\'m not sure if it\\'s still my favorite in the series,but it\\'s still high on my list., The Harry Potter Books are now my favorites, highly recommended to anyone, it doesn\\'t matter if you have seen the movies or not but trust me they are nothing compared to the books., My only comment is, sometimes I wish Hermione would just shut up! Otherwise great conclusion (well somewhat conclusion) to the Voldemort conflict. Can\\'t wait to read the next one!, MAGNIFICENT, Of course I love all of the HP books but what I liked most about this one was the insight in to Riddle\\'s background and how Harry will need to use this to defeat him. This also has the most devastating death scene of the series, at least for me, preparing for the last book when Harry feels like he\\'s all alone (except for the as always awesome Hermione who spends too much time mooning over an undeserving idiot in this book)., One of my favorites in the Harry Potter series, Rowling makes the series significantly darker, where the previously invincible and all-wise Dumbledore isn\\'t able to solve everyone\\'s problems. Also, the conclusion is classic - no deus ex, proper planning, baffling, yet hugely entertaining., Ending was so sad in this book but still was a great way to continue the story and add more depth to this already amazing series. \\n Highly Recommended, By the end of the book, it seems like it should\\'ve been joined with the next one. It\\'s probably the most depressing end of any of the books in the series., I\\'ve got tears in my ears from reading the end of this while lying on my back in bed., ry\\'`h, Yea ... i cried. \\n Its always astonishing how this book series manages to go to such dark places, but always leaves a light out. Every single time i read them! \\n I\\'m off now reading the final book, and recommend everyone to go and read the books already! (i dont think there are many people left who havent, but still), ** spoiler alert ** \\n I think I would\\'ve enjoyed this book more if I didn\\'t know how it ended. \\n Also, was it just me or did Ginny x Harry seem to appear out of nowhere?, I think they just keep getting better and better! Liked the different twist that Voldemort doesn\\'t come back but you learn HOW he can keep coming back again and again (that was getting old in the previous books). Sad ending . . ., This one moved soooo much faster than 5. Loved it., !NO PUEDE SER! \\n !NO PUEDE SER! \\n !NO PUEDE SER! \\n Ya sabia como iba a culminar este libro, LO SABIA sin embargo no dejo de sorprenderme. \\n Este libro fue magnifico, las historias, los celos que sentia Harry, el miedo de Draco, el Dolor de Hagrid, la maldad de Tom. \\n TODO fue increible y sigo firme en que ese final destrozo mi corazon., go harry potter! woohoo!, <3 oh God!, A falta de leer el ultimo libro de la saga, este me ha parecido el mas complejo, el mejor escrito y, por supuesto, el mas adictivo. Me ha dejado enamorado para siempre de esta saga y estos personajes. !Merece la pena haber llegado hasta aqui solo para leer este libro!, Does your love has limits?, Most recent re-read in November 2015. \\n I love this book so much and all of the horrible feels it gives me., Boo hooooooo hoooooo, Finally doing Snape\\'s character justice. I felt the reader got to see the turmoil and maybe continue to doubt his motives., Re-read, This book is amazing. Absolutely brilliant. The plot is so intricate and thought out to perfection, every little detail worked out. The ending is so sad, and full of darkness and death ahead, but lit with rays of hope. I love this book, I love the whole series. Competely amazing., This book is really great. This is when you start to really get attached to character and root for Harry and the gang. Its just awesome and with the big spoiler that happens it is just so sad but perfection., Best book series ever written., \"There was no waking from this nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors had died, and he was more alone than he had ever been.\" \\n No one warned me this series would break my heart over and over again., REREAD MAY 2015: \\n This is definitely the filler book in the series. It takes a good 60% for anything significant to happen, and even though the final few chapters are well written, it never really feels like it\\'s own book. It\\'s more just setting the scene for the final book. \\n That said I enjoyed it more this time around than the first time (I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve only read this once), and it\\'s ending goes quite a way to making up for the slow first half., my favorite in the series, DRAMATIC END ! \\n The story continues of course. There were some great moments in this one ! Ron and Hermione getting together ! Harry And Ginny ! That escalated way too fast ! \\n Strange to say but the Romance part of the book was only the entertaining part for me ! Until the end drama of course. The entire time the story was so dull. Stuck only to \" What\\'s MALFOY DOING ? \". It missed that \\'adventure\\' part of fantasy world. There were hardly any new characters or new places. So yeah. I had to push myself through 75% of the book. \\n The ending was good! That saved the book ! \\n SPOILER \\n Woah! Snape killing dumbledore ! Couldn\\'t have thought abt it ! That was certainly unexpected. Why did Dumbledore trust Snape so much? I hope they answer that in the next book. The last book I think will be the best one ! \\n Also I still don\\'t approve of Fleur and Bill\\'s Wedding :p, Wonderful, as always. I\\'ve lost count of which number re-read this was., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Brilliant story. Knowing what I know now, having read the series all the way through a few times, this reread provided much more depth. For example, I had never caught the fact that Voldemort truly did curse the Defense Against the Dark Arts position (pg. 446). I mean, I had assumed, but I had never truly known. \\n I understood Snape\\'s actions this time through as well and it made the book all the more interesting as I tried to work everything out. \\n I\\'ve also decided that Hagrid acts as a bridge between the understood and the feared; he is a friend to all creatures, deadly or not, and it is he who carries Dumbledore to his tomb and he also carries Harry back to the castle when Voldemort believes him to be dead . \\n I loved watching the friendship between Ron and Hermione blossom into a romance, not to mention the relationship between Harry and Ginny which doesn\\'t really get anywhere until the end of the book. \\n All in all, this is a very good book and it is a part of a brilliant series I believe I will enjoy in every stage of my life. \\n Update: 8 times I\\'ve read this book. 8. I enjoyed it far better in this reading because I didn\\'t let myself spend the book furious at Dumbledore. I\\'ve done that in the past and all it did was make the book a chore to get through. I\\'m still bugged at Dumbledore and his secrets, and bothered that no one ever listens to Harry despite the fact that her guesses proved to be right nearly every time throughout the series, but in a far more reserved corner of my mind. Severus Snape\\'s betrayal was more fun to read with this attitude as well. Who cares if everyone\\'s wrong about him? For the sake of this book, he\\'s a traitor, and after all the abuse he has thrown at the students throughout the rest of the series, I\\'m quite content to send him some hate in return. (Yes I know he\\'s fictional, but why on earth should that mean that my feelings about him and the impact the books have had on me aren\\'t entirely real?), Why did I wait so long to read these? Looking forward to the seventh and final, but already regretting that it is coming to an end., Enjoyed the back story about the villain of the story. Loved the end story, had my imagination reeling on exactly what it would look like., Love every one of the Harry potter books- have read many times!, ceritanya menarik, dan tidak bisa ditebak, Don\\'t touch me. \\n I is emotional. \\n I love Harry Potter., The first book I ever cried too when I was a kid..., I honestly \\n cant stop \\n crying..., There isn\\'t much to say about Harry Potter that hasn\\'t been said. One of my favourite series :), Man, do I love this book! It is absolutely amazing. \\n Let me just say, I am a hardcore shipper of Harry & Ginny, and Ron & Hermione. \\n Harry and Ginny got together and I started squealing. I seriously think they are just amazing together. \\n Ron dates Lavendar, which is probably just the most hilarious thing ever. But what I loved was when Ron was in the hospital and he asked for Hermione. \\n I always hated Lavendar, so I loved that so much. \\n Anyways, the half-blood prince plot was quite interesting. At first, it wasn\\'t. But let me just say, I NEVER TRUSTED SNAPE. HA! \\n I cried at Dumbledore\\'s funeral. It was...depressing. \\n This book is amazing. Just read it., Prima lettura - Ita, I grew up reading HP and I have always loved it, every bit of it! Half-blood prince for me was the best novel. I really think it showed a bigger part of the pre-story we never knew before. Also it showed what made Snape exactly the way he was. I\\'m not going to spoil it for anyone who ( has lived under under a rock and) haven\\'t read it,but I strongly reccomend it., Harry Potter #6: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, by J. K. Rowling \\n The first time I read \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,\" I don\\'t remember liking it all that much. After \"Order of the Phoenix,\" it just seemed less complex, shorter, and...I can\\'t quite remember. But for me, \"Half-Blood Prince,\" like \"Order of the Phoenix,\" is a book that gets better and better each time I read it. \\n I\\'ve also read online that J. K. Rowling considers \"Half-Blood Prince\" and \"Deathly Hallows\" as two parts of the same book, and when I keep that in mind, I like \"Half-Blood Prince\" even more. \\n The Ministry of Magic has finally been forced to acknowledge that Voldemort is back. Harry, Ron, and Hermione scan The Daily Prophet for names of his newest victims, and even Muggles are starting to notice mysterious deaths and weird disasters. \\n Professor Dumbledore takes Harry under his wing, finally answering some of the questions Harry has had for years. In private lessons, Dumbledore recounts Voldemort\\'s history as Tom Riddle and his rise as a Dark wizard. Harry learns about Horcruxes, magical objects that are the key to Voldemort\\'s immortality. Finding and destroying Horcruxes becomes the main focus of this and the last book in the series. \\n In their sixth year at Hogwarts, the gang balances the fear of Voldemort\\'s return, a new Potions teacher, and put up with Snape as the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry\\'s hormones start to kick in, and while he realizes he likes Ginny Weasley, he\\'s hesitant to date her as her brother is his best friend. And with the help of an old Potions textbook, Harry becomes a superstar in a subject he once hated. \\n For me the best part of \"Half-Blood Prince\" is learning Voldemort\\'s backstory, as well as the shift of the series into a more adult tone. There is a lot going on in this book (as in all Harry Potter books), and a few more questions posed. Make sure you can readily get \"Deathly Hallows,\" because you\\'ll be rushing for it after finishing \"Half-Blood Prince.\" \\n 5/5., This is the book of surprises. Best surprises ever!, I read this the night before it was \"officially\" released and didn\\'t love it. I have read it (and listened to Jim Dale\\'s much-better-than-the-movie readings) a number of times since, and as I see how well it blends into the overall plot, I have come to like it a lot more. But I still find the boy/ girl sequences silly and awkward., rereading with my son!!!!, This is my favorite book in the entire series. Harry, Ron and Hermione are no longer little kids but they are still at Hogwarts. I love that they are finally moving into having relationships and falling in love (which is usually my favorite part of books). In this book Dumbledore is finally has a big role and appears several times to help Harry better understand Voldemort and the task at hand. \\n Finally, in this book it is spelled plain out that Hermione and Ron have a thing for each other, this was my favorite part when I first read this book. I remember when I first read the part with Ron taking the love potion and I didn\\'t realize what was happening only that he was telling Harry he was in love with someone I was absolutely ecstatic in thinking he meant Hermione. I was wrong of course but I still love that chapter. \\n Then on top of Ron and Hermione we get a love interest for Harry too. I However didn\\'t like this relationship as much but eh it\\'s slightly better than Cho and Harry. \\n Now that I am re-reading the series I have found that I just don\\'t feel any chemistry between Harry and his love interest. I think that is why I just don\\'t feel as interested or invested in his love interest. \\n First he likes Cho but up until the moment that he states how pretty she is while playing quidditch against her she isn\\'t even mentioned, then every time after that when they encounter each other Harry\\'s thoughts tells us how much he likes her and this is fine and dandy but I just don\\'t feel a connection with his fancying her. Pretty much he just decides oh I like Cho because she is pretty and I don\\'t really know her but I\\'m going to pine over her for the next year or so until I actually go on one date with her and realize she\\'s a complete pain and at that point I will pretty much just forget about her all together. For me it just doesn\\'t work I need interaction and little hints of chemistry. \\n Now as I am reading this book I again feel a lack of a back relationship between Ginny and Harry before he is over his head in love with her. Sure in book 2 we are introduced fully to Ginny Weasley\\'s character, outside the little platform introduction that I don\\'t count from book 1, she is Ron\\'s little sister that has a sort of celebrity crush on Harry. Harry saves her life and all that good stuff but they are like twelve so it\\'s not some epic romance in development just Harry living up to the Hero role. After that Ginny pops in and out of the books casually always seen pretty much for being Ron\\'s little sister and we don\\'t really get to see her development into her teen years the way we do with Harry. For me until the fifth book (and even for a good part of the fifth book) in my mind she is still that little eleven year old trapped in the chamber of secrets. The fifth book Ginny is a more frequent character starting in the beginning chapters and until the big battle at the ministry but still I don\\'t feel any kind of inkling that either Harry or her like each other, she has a few boyfriends in this year and I guess that is a hint that she isn\\'t the little girl anymore but really Harry doesn\\'t notice or have any pang of jealousy. (Still talking book 5) Yes, I know this is because he is in la-la I love Cho forever imaginary land but still I want a little development and chemistry; let\\'s face it Ron is jumping down Hermione\\'s throat every time he mention\\'s Krum why can\\'t Harry show some of these emotions. Even after Harry has completely wrote off Cho and we move into the sixth book where he is going to get with Ginny there\\'s not really any hints until almost halfway through the book. \\n I feel like it would have felt more satisfying for me if there had been bigger hints towards this relationship before it just was happening, then I could have been at least cheering for Harry and Ginny. \\n When I read this book the first time I was right there with cheering Harry on to be against Snape and Draco, this time I just see how foolish Harry acts becoming so obsessed with them. He is repeatedly told by everyone to just let it go and in the end being himself he doesn\\'t listen. I think his hate for these characters is always causes Harry to have twice as many obstacle\\'s then he would have. As I read this time I paid close attention to Snape and how everything between him and Dumbledore could have two meanings. If Harry would have just trust Dumbledore instead of insisting he could make mistakes he would have save himself a ton of time and energy. \\n Ever since I finished the entire series years ago Snape has been one of my Favorite Characters. I seriously cry every single time I read or watch Snape\\'s last memories. \\n This time as I re-read this book I kind of thought of something I never put too much thought into before and that was that everyone saying if Dumbledore had so much trust in Snape why didn\\'t he give him the DADA job. Now I guess it\\'s pretty clear to me that Dumbledore knew that the position was cursed and didn\\'t give him the job because he need him to stick around, but then gives it to him in the sixth year because he knows that it is time for Snape to leave and join Voldemort. In a way I guess that when Snape was given the job at the beginning of the book it should have been obvious that Snape would be leaving Hogwarts by the end of the book and not returning as the Dark Arts teacher. \\n This book gets me ever time also, late last night while I finished off that last few chapters of this book I was crying like a baby the whole time. When a book can make me feel that much, that is what makes it a favorite book for me. I enjoy books that make me cry. \\n One last thing I want to mention before a top five list is the artwork in these books. When I started re-reading the series the pictures were kind of silly looking if I am being honest. But around book 4 the art gets so much better and this books art is probably my favorite so far. I thought the change and development of the art through the books was very interesting. \\n Top 5 Favorite Parts \\n 5. Harry and Ginny kiss \\n 4. Arogog\\'s Funeral \\n 3. Tonk\\'s and Remus \\n 2. The entire last three chapters \\n 1. Ron taking the love potion, :x, I like how we get to see more of the Marauders era, since they all play such an integral part in this one. Poor Harry though, having to save the world, be a teenage boy and do school work, no matter how awesome magic is., ** spoiler alert ** \\n This is my favorite harry potter book so far, though i havent read Deathly Hollows yet. This is the most interesting, yet saddest book from the 6 that I\\'ve read. I have to say that when Harry and Dumbledore relived memories through the Pensieve, it sorta reminded me of The Giver, when he gave The Receiver memories. One of best books I\\'ve read., First time through this, I admit to skimming (hey three other people in the house were telling me to hurry up even though I finished it the day we got it...). A slower read adds so much to the characterization..., I cried so very much with his book... \\n I think in this book you can start forseeing the end of the saga, but not that much that make it predictible. I like what J.K. Rowling did with this book and with the whole saga, What can I possibly say about this wonderful book. There was so much laughter and sadness yet she found a way to end the book on a hopeful note. I loved the way Harry stood up to the ministry especially after everything they did to him the year before. LOL, i will never get over the ending of this book and i will cry, as i just did, every time i think of this book. no words can describe this book or how i feel about it. oh my god., aaaaAAAaaa (=.=) ]:, Favorite quotes: \\n \"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" page 566, Ugh the feels. I was hit with them all over again. I am probably going to fly through the seventh next...so much for re-reading them slowly., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Ok so I am so behind like the whole world right now. And now I can imagine the shock that everybody received years ago. I am going to hide my review because of spoilers. But here is what I think.... \\n I love Snape. I love his character, he is so misunderstood and I just could not get through this series without him. I don\\'t care if I end up being dead wrong, but it was all planned. Dumbledore asked Snape to kill him. I JUST KNOW IT... And Snape is not a traitor he can\\'t be. Dumbledore was no idiot. He trusted Snape. I don\\'t know why Dumbledore thought this was how it had to be. \\n And there is a small part of me that thinks Dumbledore might just rise from the dead. I still can\\'t believe it. Dumbledore is the greatest character. I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do if Dumbledore really is dead. \\n Ginny as Harry\\'s girl. First of the all the movie really played this up but I just don\\'t get this relationship. They hardly ever spend any time together and now all of sudden Harry is into her. I mean I never shipped Hermione and Harry, no way. But Ginny really??? Can\\'t we do better than her... Plus don\\'t you think it is really creepy that she looks just like his mom... I mean just like her. \\n Anyways, I\\'m freaking out right now because my best friend who got me into this crazy series in the first place is not answering her phone... and I need to talk about all my feels in regards to this book....... My head is spinning right now. I have to get my hands on the next book., The war against Voldemort is not going well; even the Muggle governments are noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of the Daily Prophet, looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. \\n All I am going to say is we need to bow down to J.K. Rowling. She is a genius., Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince by J.K. Rowling is the 6th in the series. \\n Harry Potter continues to enthrall. The books, although for all ages, are getting darker. We have lost Cedric. We have lost Sirius. Now we lose another. \\n It starts with visits...the Ministry of Magic visiting the Prime Minister in the Muggle World.....Narcissa Malfoy visiting Severus Snape....and Dumbledore visting Harry at the Dursleys. \\n A new Potions teacher, Horace Slughorn will join the school, and Snape will be teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts (much to Harry\\'s disappointment). Slughorn has a secret that Dumbledore desperately needs, and he instructs Harry to discover it. Dumbledore and Harry will work closely together to try and put an end to Voldemort. \\n Harry discovers he is excellent at Potions, as long as he uses the instructions in the book he found by someone called the Half-Blood Prince. This book may not be a good idea. \\n Harry is suspicious when he saw Malfoy in a store called Borgin & Berkes. He thinks Malfoy is a death eater, like his father. When strange things happen at school, they seem to confirm his suspicions. \\n On a lighter note, sort of, romance is in the air, and it is putting a strain on the relationship between Harry, Ron and Hermione. When Ron discovers Hermione kissed Viktor Krum, he is not impressed. Suddenly he is dating Lavender Brown. Now Hermione is not impressed. Harry is finding himself very interested in Ginny, but doesn\\'t know how to tell Ron. \\n The ending is not happy. We lose someone else. Someone we have loved since Book 1. We know there is a reason for everything, but it is so hard. \\n Deep breath. Okay, Rowling did another superb job of leading us from one dark event to the next, with so much suspense thrown in and an ending that takes us by surprise. How could you not want to continue?, I thought this was may favorite of the books until I read book 7. Professor Snaith is one of my favorite characters as he always seems so fraught with internal struggle. Its fun watching Harry grow up in the books. Rowling isn\\'t afraid to who him be very annoying and bratty very much like the hormonal 16 year old can be., ** spoiler alert ** \\n In this Harry Potter, they begin the search for the Horcruxes. In an incredibly memorable moment, Harry has to force a potion down Dumbledore\\'s throat, despite his cries for him to stop. And that was not the worst of it. Once again, impossible to put down. Another great Harry Potter Book., I\\'m so sad....., THIS BOOK BROKE MY HEART. SO MANY TEARS., it was more entertaining than the Order of the Phoenix, I\\'ll give it that. a lot happened. some cool info. enough action to merit a 4 star. \\n dislikes, Harry was whiny and there\\'s no way that friends wouldn\\'t have taken him seriously about his suspicions so a little aggravating. and the last few pages were anti climactic in my opinion. I had expected the tribute to Dumbledore to be a little more centered around Dumbledore but almost the entire funeral was Harry\\'s selfish internal monologue about himself. \\n just saying, This is my second favorite book of the Harry Potter series. I really enjoyed the series more and more as the students grew older and the tale became somewhat darker., Amazing, of course, but this book just tore me, and for many reasons!!!, This is in my top 3 favorite books from this series for a number of reasons: \\n 1) it sets the reader up perfectly for the final installment. \\n 2) *SPOILER ALERT* having one of the main characters killed in this book was the best thing J.K. Rowling could have done: it added so much more mystery and uncertainty to the final book. \\n LOVE this series!, FANTASTICO. Mi infancia y adolescencia es esta saga., Another Harry Potter book... well, i have to know the ending, now!, :), This is the first of the books that I bought on the release date- lets just say I came a little late to the party. However I am ashamed to say that it took me almost a full year after the release date to get around to reading it. At the time of the release I was working for a book store and after the thousands of calls I made to let our customers know that their copy would be available, all the events that were planned for the day, and the weekend itself I was a little Harry Pottered out for awhile. \\n When I did finally get around to reading it I was pleasantly surprised to find a much more likable, less whiny Harry., I might not have been my favourite in the series, i still think the plot was interesting and exciting., With ever Harry Potter book I read, I find another new favorite book. I thought I was shocked by the death of Sirius, but nothing compared to this shocker. I kept reading, expecting it to not be true, right to the very last page. Then I started the next one, thinking something would happen to make it untrue. So far nothing has, though. I can\\'t wait to see how this series ends, but then again, I\\'m not ready for it to be over., My favorite Harry Potter book! This one is absolutely amazing, and is an all-time favorite of mine. This book has it all. I\\'ve read it three times, most recently because of the premiere of the movie., What is there to say about a book that doesn\\'t grab you? The series is competently written and cleverly imagined. I read them with pleasure, but would not be distressed if they were suddenly to disappear from existence. To each his own taste, eh?, harry potter and the half blood prince was not the best of the harry potter series but i could not put it down once i had started reading it. It did make me cry alot but the whole book itself was definitely worth it, Read in 2007, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, by J.K. Rowling, is another incredible account on the life of Harry Potter. Entering his sixth year at the acclaimed school of witchcraft and wizardry, Hogwarts, Harry is faced with an even tougher set of tasks than ever before. Throughout the year, Dumbeldore calls upon him occasionally for some \"private lessons\", but Harry soon finds out that these lessons are not for practicing his magic. No, Dumbeldore calls upon Harry to once again delve into the Pensieve, and explore the many memories people have of a younger Tom Marvolo Riddle, or Lord Voldemort. The reason Dumbeldore is doing this is because he believes he has found the secret to Voldemort\\'s power: Horcruxes, and the only way they will be able to find the horcruxes is to find objects that Voldemort was very attached to. Horcruxes are a very dangerous and dark type of magic in which one slices up his/her soul and hides it in objects, so even when they die, they aren\\'t really dead until ALL of their soul is destroyed. Dumbeldore believes that he has found one of Voldemort\\'s horcruxes and wants Harry to come and help him destroy it. \\n I give this book 5out of 5 stars because I believe this is a book in which many teenagers and even adults can relate. Rowling, including the other five books in the series, creates an imaginative world, but that relates to society today, which is why they are all so popular. Rowling assembles her characters so that many different types of children can relate to them. For example, Ron is struggling with his hormones and is continually \"snogging\" with his newfound girlfriend Lavender, but isn\\'t really sure about the whole relationship thing. Now many teenage boys (or girls) can definitely relate to this! Most boys aren\\'t sure what the heck they feel and go with their first instinct: to get a girlfriend no matter what. This relation to the real world, and many others, is part of the reason why I love these books and why so many others do as well. \\n The last reason (but not the only reasons) I give this book 5 out of 5 stars is because of the intense suspense and just how well the book is written. Just like every other Harry Potter, every single page leaves you begging you for more. Personally, I\\'d just read these books for hours on end if I could. Rowling ends every chapter in a way that you can\\'t just put it down and stop reading for the day: you HAVE to keep reading. The plot in this Harry Potter is incredibly thought out, super exciting, but surprisingly simple, which I think is why many people read it so often. It is not difficult to understand at all but the imagination Rowling put into writing is (and all the others) is astonishing. \\n In conclusion, I give this book 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an amazing book to read. This is my favorite series of books EVER and this is my 2nd favorite one in the series, next to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire., Great book., *cries for an eternity*, I wasn\\'t expecting to like this one as much as I did!, Oh My Lanta. This is the best HP book so far., it was amazing, I loved this book maybe more than all of the others. Learning the history of Voldemort made it impossible to put the book down!, Different from all the other books, interesting to see harry finally starting to prepare for the big fight against voldemort, Although I love this series and find it an easy book to read where you really can just get lost into the magical realm of Harry and his friends this is not my favourite one. \\n It reveals a lot for what is to come and of course we get our famous death of Dumbledore. I was a little moved by this, but not as much as some of the characters. I guess this just made me realise how much this character really meant to me. \\n The idea of Horocrux\\'s is all in all a pretty cool trope and in a way I wish I had come up with such an idea for a book or story. It not only made me think of how they would be made but if I could actually go through that myself. \\n All in all it\\'s a brilliant book that advances the story and sets up for the ending., Getting close to the end of the series and i\\'m excited and at the same time a little bit sad. \\n I can\\'t think of the Harry Potter\\'s books as different part, to me they feel like the same huge book and everytime i read a new chapter. \\n i really liked how i watched all the characters grow up and face uncountable dangers, all of this created a sort of bond. With every new part i feel like meeting old friends. \\n This part was a little bit different, more interesting and touching. I liked it how the life of Lord Voldermort was retraced, he was no longuer just a shadow. \\n i greatly enjoyed this book and i can\\'t wait to read the next and last one., Seg som jag ar har jag nu tagit upp Potter-serien sedan jag borjade lasa forsta boken nar jag var 11-12. Otvivelaktigt en av de basta bokserierna., Just like The Goblet of Fire, this story didn\\'t started with Harry Potter\\'s point of view. It started with the conversation between the Muggle\\'s Prime Minister, Fudge and the newest Minister of the Ministry of Magic. After the revelations from the previous books, this one didn\\'t failed me at all considering that it doesn\\'t have \"my usual\" Harry Potter POV in its first chapter. Well, the resurrection of my 5 star rating is the evidence as you can see. *wink \\n After the saddened departure of Sirius Black from the previous book, this story sort of started a bit grim primarily for Harry because he\\'s as close as a father to him and I can\\'t help but really feel sad for him. But the grim feeling instantly wiped away from my memory when I reached the second chapter where Harry went to the Burrow to spend his remaining summer days before the new school term starts. Why\\'s that? Well, you can always count on with the Weasley family to make you laugh. And I can\\'t believe I would still be able to enjoy this story even if the twins isn\\'t at Hogwarts anymore. I can\\'t even believe until now that Mrs. Weasley will approve with that, but seeing them now, I guess they are really doing great with their business eh? \\n I don\\'t have any memory of the film about this book, so all scenes we\\'re kind of surprising to me and I can\\'t really wait until I finally able to finish this series and watch the movie again so I could finally compare. It was kinda sad though because I\\'ve grown some fondness for this series, and that being said, I\\'ll be sure to read more from J.K. Rowling in no time haha. \\n Just like the previous book, this one also caters some sort of scenes we\\'re almost all the main characters have a love life except for Hermione (because both Ron and her still can\\'t confessed their feelings lol). And finally, Harry now noticed \"something\" between Ron and Hermione and that itself intensified my desire to read more. But unfortunately, they still didn\\'t confessed their feelings in this book. Gladly, Harry and Ginny is finally dating, ayyeeei! Back with the film, I am not really a fan of Ginny. I don\\'t know, but the only thing I remember from the film was that, Harry and Ginny just happen. No sparks unlike Ron and Hermione. I am always a sucker for love-hate romance so no wonder I am always rooting for them lol, haha. \\n What I also like about reading all the books in this series was that, all makes sense now. I think it\\'s finally safe to say that I now know about Harry and Voldemort. On how they became mortal enemies and how Voldemort became a sucker for power. Also, reading the book makes me understand more about the characters, and how they feel about everything which is hard to noticed when you\\'ve just watched the film and not reading the book. Like for example, how Harry finally starts to like Ginny more than a friend and ofcourse, I instantly became a fan of their love team because of that. \\n I don\\'t really want this review to be a total bummer but I guess it\\'s going to be a bit well-known to everyone especially if they happen to watched the film already. Which I think, I\\'m just the only one who failed to anticipate that at all. So when I reached \"that\" scene, I was so surprised. Dang! What exactly I am talking about? Well, Dumbledore is dead. Huhu! Ofcourse I know that will happen eventually, but I though it\\'ll be on the 7th book! And I can recall, it\\'s quite different from the film. I was so taken aback that I find myself crying until I was sobbing. Yep, I was sobbing like a baby who was deprived of her favorite candy. And remembering it now, I can\\'t help but get teary-eyed again. I never cried this hard even if I found out that Finch killed himself at All The Bright Places by Jennifer Niven or when Will breath his last at Me Before You by Jojo Moyes and much more to my surprise when they executed Ned at A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin. And that alone should speaks itself why this book definitely deserve my 5-star rating even if one of my favorite character was dead. \\n Now, there\\'s 1 more book for me to read to finish this series. But I guess I have to U-turn for a while because a friend of mine suggested that I will understand The Deathly Hollows more if I read the Tale of Beedle and the Bard first. \\n I can\\'t believe that it just took me 12 days to finish the 6 books in this series considering I have been busy with my day job lately, haha. \\n The Harry Potter series is really highly recommended and I can\\'t wait to discuss more about Harry Potter with you. And I guess I can now finally say that I am officially a fan. *wink \\n Rating: 5 out of 5 stars \\n Read my full review post \\n Buy Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Kindle) \\n Buy Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Paperback) \\n Buy Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Paperback) \\n To read more of my reviews, book news and updates: \\n Main Blog: Blushing Geek \\n Facebook Page \\n Subscribe to mailing list, My review on the sixth book of the Harry Potter series: http://bondwithbooks.wordpress.com/20..., great great story..alot of adventures,way cooler than the movie, a quite different too., Es asombroso. Se ha convertido en uno de mis libros favoritos de la saga y de la vida., Harry begins the journey to adulthood in this book. Dumbledore takes him on as an apprentice, seeking the keys to the downfall of Lord Voldemort and Harry is eager to embrace the responsibility even as he enters his first serious love relationship after watching Ron and Hermonie implode. \\n Highly recommended., Loved it! That darn Snape! I enjoyed the presence of Dumbledore and all his wisdom. Being able to love is the greatest gift of all., :D :o :\\'(, Definitely the best Potter book I have read in my binge catch-up on one of the biggest cultural phenomena of the last decade or so. I did skim read some of the earlier books when they branched off into all the coming-of-age teenage stuff, which don\\'t really appeal to a man in his forties. This one I didn\\'t skim at all, as it stuck largely to moving the story on and setting up the conclusion., I liked all of the previous books a little better than this one. In this the story dragged on a little and I just wanted to get to the end., First Read - release night \\n Second and third - ?? \\n Fourth - 2013, My heart is in pieces. For many reasons. Ahhhhh., \"The Ones that Love Us, Never Really Leave Us\" \\n Dumbledore, you will be missed <3, This was a re-read for me. \\n Things I liked/noticed about this particular installment: \\n + I really like Professor Slughorn. He\\'s just so good-natured in this one, and I love how he throws all these parties and everything. It\\'s oddly hilarious to me. \\n + LUNA. Luna Lovegood is my favorite character. She\\'s actually probably in my Top 3 favorite characters of all time. I know that if I went to Hogwarts we would get along so well. \\n + The disappearing cabinet with Malfoy doesn\\'t play as big of a part as it does in the movie? Which is a weird thing to say, since Harry is obsessing over Malfoy the whole book, but we don\\'t really know he\\'s up to something until the very end. \\n + Quidditch. I love it in this one. How Ron proves himself to be a good Keeper without any help, when he thinks he took the lucky potion. \\n + It\\'s always killed me a bit inside that the diadem was RIGHT. THERE. \\n This has always been one of my favorite installments in the Harry Potter series. It doesn\\'t have very many boring parts in it. I will probably re-read this again in the future as well., This has got to be one of the best books in the series! \\n It amazes me how J.K. Rowling manages to always come up with new plots and new twists when it comes to the story of Harry Potter. It never gets boring or cyclical. You can always expect one surprise after the next. \\n In HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOODED PRINCE, Rowling breaks down a lot of background information for the books before. She takes us into the past and delves into the history and lives of many characters. We begin to realize that things are not always as they seem. \\n There is not much to say in this review, without giving away too much of the book, but I will say that it is the most emotional of all six installments. You definitely get a sense that finality is not far away. \\n There is of course death in the final chapter ... which is extremely tough to accept once you find out who, but what is harder to believe is the way it went down. This occurrence also will have HP fans wondering how in the world will Rowling continue the next phase of the Harry Potter series..., I cried a lot, as per usual, I read this with my son., I, again, cried my eyes out at the end..\\'. Life is not fair, but we knew that already. Beautiful book. \\n Other thoughts/reviews: \\n The Cheap Reader: http://thecheapreader.wordpress.com/2... \\n Book Journey (about the audio-book): http://bookjourney.wordpress.com/2013..., ** spoiler alert ** \\n First thing that came in my mind... \"bakit? bakit? si Dumbledore pa?!\" (Why? Why? Does it have to be Dumbledore?). But then I guess as the book and Harry\\'s story continues, life is not always rosy and good. \\n Yet again, this is a very great book, as much anticipation had been build up for the last series., How can you not give a Harry Potter book 5 stars? I dont need to do a review for JK Rowling, we all know how awesome she is. I would like to say, this particular book, well it was the last book my mother bought for me before she passed away, so I will always hang on to it. This book and the movie of this I feel are the most depressing, I cry every time I watch the Half Blood Prince. I loved and hated this one., I thoroughly enjoyed this. I got into the Harry Potter phase late after many years of persuasion from my brothers., This one is just so funnnn., This is my favorite book, along with The Sorcerer\\'s Stone. I wanted to continue reading every page. It\\'s not unnecessarily descriptive like Order of the Phoenix. It doesn\\'t drag on. I do feel that Harry and Ginny\\'s relationship seemed forced and unfortunately short lived. I wanted a little more persuasion as to why Harry suddenly fell for her. Other than that, the book is a page turner., hmyn chnd dqyqh pysh tmwmsh khrdm w bh m`ny wq`y khlmh Hlm khwb nyst :) \\n dlm mykhwd gryh wly gryh m nmyd :(( \\n fkh khnm yn khtb mwrd `lqh m bshh z mjmw`h...., **4.5 Stars, Not my favorite of the series, it felt mostly like just build up to the finale book. Still a good read was just waiting for something., 4.92 STARS \\n [Spoilers] \\n WHY DID DUMBLEDORE DIE?!?! IT WAS TOO SAD AND HARRY BARELY HAD ANYONE AND THEN WE HAD TO LOSE DUMBLEDORE!, Re-reading for the umpteenth time but via audio book this time and it\\'s awesome!!! ;), ** spoiler alert ** \\n DUMBLEDORE IS MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER IN ALL OF THE BOOKS I HAVE READ WHAT THE FUCK MY EYES HURT AND MY HEART MY POOR POOR HEART, This one had me canatonic for a few hours after. But is of course, absolutely brilliant., I thought (hoped?) that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix would be the nadir for my emotions during the series. I thought wrong. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince makes the previous book seem giddy by comparison. Murder is no longer something that happened in a dark past, or accidentally when a stunned wizard falls beyond the veil, or might happen if the Dark Lord returns at an uncertain future point. In Harry\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts, darkness has arrived fully. Taboo curses and hexes are thrown about recklessly. Even Harry and Hermione use confounding or harming curses to get what they want. Power, even killing power, is intoxicating in the adult world Hogwarts students are being forced to enter earlier and earlier. \\n In the midst of this increasingly evident evil, Rowling gives plenty of room for love, shared suffering, and an almost pastoral sense of binding deep emotional wounds. Slughorn\\'s prayer at Aragog\\'s graveside is beautiful, healing for Hagrid, and, it\\'s spider-king focus aside, could be straight out of the Book of Common Prayer. Rowling\\'s depiction of grief\\'s unpredictable and nonlinear path rings very true for me as a pastor, former chaplain, and visitor of the sick. And I am very glad that no one--not Harry, Neville, Tonks, Hagrid, Mrs. Weasley, and on--have to face sorrow and fear alone. \\n Typically, I like a little uncertainty mixed into my stories. Some doubt as to whether or not good will triumph over evil makes for interesting reads. Harry Potter\\'s different for me, though. I want to know that Dumbledore\\'s loving vision will win out over Voldemort\\'s purist-racist hogwash. Maybe it\\'s that kids are the main protagonists and the unfathomable massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School just happened. Maybe it\\'s a spiritual yearning for Easter/resurrection over Good Friday/death. Or maybe it\\'s Rowling\\'s knack for creating lovable characters. Whatever the mixture of reasons, I need the good and true to triumph here. A brief moratorium on Lovecraftian pessimistic universes, I think. Let\\'s see what powering through Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows does for a case of the existential blues., When life is not always smile.. \\n When truth is not always happiness.., NO DUMBLE NO NO NO FIRST SIRIUS NOW DUMBLEDORE WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS, What did I do to deserve this. \\n I\\'m blinded by my tears now so no review, Almost completed a re-read of the Harry Potter books. I haven\\'t read this volume for years - partly because of the loss of a certain beloved character... - but so glad that I finally did. I think this is now one of my favourites. Poignant, full of heart, and plenty of humour. And the way JK Rowling writes about grief hits you right in the guts., 4.5 stars, This is by far my favourite, \"When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love.\" \\n Here J.K. Rowling was getting me used to longer books, but for this one she trimmed off a few hundred pages. Honestly the story didn\\'t contain as much in some ways as the previous two that were longer, so the page length fit it. It\\'s that semi-awkward stage book where it\\'s going to lead to the last big-bang fight and wrap-up, has to introduce new stuff for the story but play on the old without wrapping that up just yet. \\n Harry has lost his mope from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, feeling accepted again amongst his peers and not left out in the dark any longer, but he retains the natural anger and fear that he should have in his circumstance. There\\'s some mini developments between him and a female character romantically wise, which to me fits the series well. Hermione and Ron also are leaning toward each other more, even if they haven\\'t made it officially official just yet. \\n If you\\'re a fan of Dumbledore, this book will both please and infuriate you. He\\'s in more scenes than ever while he gives Harry private lessons, showing both his and other people\\'s memories, all leading to a fascinating backstory focusing on Voldemort. You don\\'t actually get to see the monstrous villain in this book - you only hear about him, which is typical of the earlier installments. There\\'s a few death eaters popping up though, including Fenrir, a new big-bad I hadn\\'t noticed before, a demented werewolf of all things. Can I just say this guy is actually creepy? Especially his focus on hurting and turning children. \\n As always these books are impossible to put down, since Rowling\\'s writing technique not only rocks, but she gives us unique characters who are individuals standing out from each other while working toward standing together unified. Rowling always introduces a new stand-out character in books; here it\\'s a new potions master who enjoys fame and getting to know students who he has determined are \\'going places.\\' Dumbledore has something else up his sleeve about this teacher, too... \\n Pacing wise it\\'s okay, as this book is more of a filler than anything, but it does give us one big revelation concerning Voldemort. All the other books pointed toward this, but it\\'s now more obvious coming together when Harry sees the larger picture. While a stepping stone to the next book, \\'The Half-Blood Prince\\' is in no way boring. You get to see Harry with his friends and relationships, a little in the classes and especially wondering who on earth the Half-Blood prince is. That mystery intrigued me since I couldn\\'t figure it out for awhile, and I\\'d forgotten since watching the movie years back. \\n While the new potions teacher is introduced, Snape finally gets his turn at \\'Defense against the Dark Arts.\\' I was slightly bummed we didn\\'t get to see more time spent in his class, however. I\\'ve always enjoyed the classroom teaching and experiences in the other books, and here was a chance to see freaking SNAPE of all people talking about the dark arts! Unfortunately there\\'s just the one classroom moment. Although we don\\'t see too much on the teaching side, Snape is still brilliantly constructed and a page-stealer when he comes on scene. \\n As with the previous book, there\\'s a heartbreaking ending to this one, so have the tissues handy. \\n I\\'ll keep them handy when I go on to the next and last book, where I know more depressing stuff will happen. And of course I\\'ll need tissues just knowing it\\'s the last book and that it\\'s time to get off this ride. :(, These books keep getting better as they go. Great twists and turns, and a very fun story., IGGPPC March 2015, Right in the feels...., I am currently a crying mess., I\\'ve got the feels!!!! This book had me in tears! It had such a sad ending. \\n This has to be my favorite Harry Potter book so far. I loved all of the flashbacks in the pensive. It gave more insight about Tom Riddle and his evilness. \\n I\\'m so happy that Harry and Ginny got together. I\\'ve heard most people say Harry and Hermione should have ended up together, but I disagree. I think Ron and Hermione are perfect for each other. She keeps him in check. \\n Drake Malfoy has gotten more evil and become a death eater, but that didn\\'t surprise me. I love Rowlings way of writing. She is extremely creative., oh gosh, I need the Deathly Hallows NOW, Incredible. Simply incredible., It\\'s been such a long time since I re-read the last two books--so refreshing. Not to mention, the narrator is excellent!, The tale has definitely taken a dark turn and although I knew that going in, I still cried as the events unraveled. Again, a very well-written continuation of the Harry Potter story. I loom forward to and also dread reading. On to see what is in store for the ending!, Why do you do this to me??, I\\'m not okay. I am NOT okay., What can I say....I LOVED IT! This book was a wonderful read with lots of new insight into the characters, revelations on the past, shocking twists and a devasting conclusion that I did not see coming! To delve any deeper into the story poses a risk of revealing too much and for those of you out there still reading this series I don\\'t want to ruin the fun. I was just glad that I had book 7 to move right onto without having to wait two years for the next installment. \\n My rating: EXCELLENT, This book is great, even greater if JK Rowling wrote more on what Voldemort\\'s where-abouts and what his mischievous plans are., Finished it earlier today, and now for the first time ever I can read the 7th book., And the series goes on... I\\'m uncertain about the intended audience with the growing romances thrown in with the magic and silliness., Full discussion here (with spoilers): https://cutloosebookloose.wordpress.c..., This is where I pretend the next book doesn\\'t happen so I can continue feeling vindicated in my dislike of Snape. This book also makes me happy because Dumbledore gives Harry much more information and better prepares him for what lies ahead instead of being quite so cryptic. I also like Slughorn and he makes me feel a bit better about Pottermore sorting me incorrectly into Slytherin. There is a practicality about him that I like - when he gathers venom from Aragog, for example. This isn\\'t one of my favorites to reread but I do enjoy remembering how shocked I was by many things in this, such as the introduction to he Horcruxes and being obsessed with trying to figure out who RAB was. \\n Reread 2016, If you haven\\'t read the Harry Potter books, first what have you been doing with your life? (Oh, you\\'re a brain surgeon? And you don\\'t have much free time between all your charity work...) Second, don\\'t start here. This is just my favourite out of a unassailably, magnificent series. \\n Has the shaping of a villain so iconic been delivered in such wonderful detail before, or as well? In comparison Darth Vader\\'s \\'oh, I had a dream my wife is going to die, quick I need to slaughter a room full of kids\\' looks as woefully half baked as it is. \\n Voldemort, yeah I\\'ll say his name, is the ultimate bad kid, made bad through neglect and the worst kind of cruelty, being unloved. Watching his decent into inhumanity is magnificent, all threaded through with clues relating to Potter\\'s greatest mystery, why was Harry \\'the boy who lived\\'? \\n And the characters... Rowling\\'s got you hopelessly invested in them by this point, and boy does she twist the knife. \\n Even if you\\'ve seen all the films (they\\'re great, but the books are stupendous) Do yourself a favour and read Potter from first to last. \\n Like all the other children and adults who will be reading them centuries from now. \\n - John Bowen is the author of \\'Where the Dead Walk\\' and \\'Vessel\\'. You can find him here on GoodReads, and his published work at Amazon., ** spoiler alert ** \\n The sixth book with just one to go, I was devastated by this book. Well-written, but heartbreaking, this was the perfect lead in to the last book. I was a bit pissed that it took so long to figure out that the Half-Blood Prince was Snape, but that\\'s just me., Tears. Lots and lots of tears. This book was actually kind of terrifying! And what a finish..., Creo que recorde porque este es mi libro menos favorito de la Saga. Aunque es un libro muy bueno y cargado de mucha informacion, es tambien un libro un poco lento y con muchas escenas que para mi gusto no tenian porque suceder. Me gusta sin embargo, que se experimentan muchas cosas a nivel de hormonas en los protagonistas. Y es tan lindo ver como Harry empieza a sentir cosas por Ginny., Hmm, endingnya lumayan... \\n Muncul petunjuk-petunjuk yang memberi harapan.. halah... \\n Apa-apaan itu si Harru dan Ginny... Hikks... \\n Keluarga besar bahagia Weasley, ceritanya..., In preparation for the movie, I am re-reading this classic! Can NOT WAIT!, This book took me awhile to finish this (like 4 months) due to me being in a reading jam for quite awhile. Though once I got back into it was great. This book was great, even through the sad, and boring parts., Made me laugh, made me cry... maybe my favorite in the Harry Potter series., I would give this book 6 stars if I could. \\n This is still my favorite HP book and Ginny is still my favorite character., perfection!, mungkin karena gw HG shipper \\n ini jadi HP fav gw bgt..^^, For the love of all things holy ... WHY IS THIS BOOK SO LONG? WHERE ARE THE EDITORS WITH THE BRIGHT RED PENS? I could have taken 150+ pages off this thing easily., WOW. I don\\'t know what to say except for the fact that this book was phenomenal., 11/1/10 - Starting up the series for, what, the eleventh time? Part of my personal HP challenge in which I must read books 1 - 6 before the release of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1\" on November 19th. \\n Started #1 on 11/1/10, finished on 11/4/10. \\n Started #2 on 11/4/10, finished on 11/6/10. \\n Started #3 on 11/6/10, finished on 11/8/10. \\n Started #4 on 11/8/10, finished on 11/14/10. \\n Started #5 on 11/14/10, finished on 11/17/10. \\n Started #6 on 11/17/10, finished on 11/19/10. \\n I just barely scrapped by! I finished the sixth book on my lunch break on the 19th. It was touch and go for a while (I struggled with finding enough time to get through the fourth book), but I got it done in the end. ;D Now that I\\'ve seen the movie in theaters (twice!), I\\'m planning on taking a leisurely stroll through the seventh book. \\n This series will forever be the nearest and dearest to my heart. <3, My favorite Harry Potter book so far. Loved book 6., Just re-read this as part of my tradition of refreshing my memory before seeing the movie. And yes, it is just as addictive the second time around!, Excellent! Was putting off this one because I was warned it was so dark, but by this time I\\'ve gotten so attached to these characters, that the time spent with them overshadowed the overall serious tone of this one. Fun one to read and discuss with your older children., A timeless classic. One of my favorites, ever. \\n My heart is broken. Every single person who reads this book for the first time (without having watched the movie before) definitely didn\\'t see it coming. J.K. overcomes herself in every book she writes and makes us fall in love all over again with her so beloved characters. It is wonderful to see them growing and being mature with everything that is (sadly) happening. Facing your fate and acknowledging that you won\\'t always have someone to look out for you all the time is some of the things you\\'ll face through this reading. Rowling will crash your heart to the soul and make you question how far would you go based on what you\\'ve been told, and what you believe., Who doesn\\'t love Harry Potter? \\n If you say ME. \\n You are the only one in the world. \\n Love this wizarding world! \\n THIS BOOK IN PARTICULAR DESTROYED ME! \\n I WAS IN SO MUCH TEARS..., Seductor y con un final mas que interesante, Harry Potter books are fun while you\\'re reading them but they\\'re basically a soap opera in book format. Very little plot but lots of contrived inter character drama. After the second one they all blur together., Loved it! Dumbledore takes Harry under his wing and shares with him glimpses of Lord Voldemort\\'s past. Harry learns what he needs to do before this last show down with Lord Voldemort arrives., El mejor libro de la saga de Harry Potter!, Harry Potter now, Harry Potter forever!, Really liked this one. She\\'s really added some depth to the series., This is my least favorite, although it\\'s pretty amazing, because it\\'s a transition book. Necessary and relevant to the story for it makes clear the points vital to the end, but not as exciting as The prisoner of Aykaban, let\\'s say. \\n What I truly loved is the loss of innocence, the you-make-your-own-future stuff and the fact that is HP., Listening to the audio book :), I know there are probably still a few grown-up readers out there who haven\\'t tried the Harry Potter series because they don\\'t feel drawn to fantasy or middle-grade/YA literature. To those readers I would just say: Me neither, but I love these books! \\n To me, the charm of the Harry Potter books lies not in their fantastic elements--though Rowling does a remarkable job with all of that--but in the characters, and in the story\\'s very powerful emotional core. If you haven\\'t already, give them a shot!, This was an audio book. Amazing read!, reread in this time in croatian. \\n still my favourite hp book :), Great, So Sadd..., One of the best books yet. Ugh I knew what was going to happen, and I still teared up. Dumbledore is one of my all time favorite characters in any book I\\'ve read, or Movie/TV Show I\\'ve seen. I read the last 200 or so pages in an airport/on a plane and it made the time go by so quickly. I\\'m so nervous to read the last one, because when I\\'m done with that...I\\'m done. This book was amazing amazing amazing, it could possibly be my favorite yet. I love that Ron and Hermione are soooo close to admitting they like each other, but it\\'s still not in reach. I ship Harry and Ginny, and I love how Harry finally just went for her. I loved the growth in Harry\\'s character as he stopped repressing his feelings and just kissed Ginny. SO EXCITED FOR THE FINAL BOOK., First read: 2006? \\n Second read: May 2012, my favorite, This was my favorite one so far. The characters are growing up and getting more interesting., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Well, i started crying. I knew that that dumbledor died but i thought it was in deathly hallows. without doubt the truth hit me in the face and tears exited. Bloody hell this is a beautiful series. im still not over it rip, Wow. Like all the books so far, well written and gripping. A sad ending, for me. \\n I mark it down (having given 5 stars for all the previous books) because it seemed to me, as if the author felt now six books in, now the characters were sixteen (and maybe the readers too?) it was time to mess around with love...or relationships, anyway. It was overdone, in my opinion. Same characters working through multiple partners...hardly a good role model, and far from normal behavior. \\n Onwards to the next book, however!! :-), The ending of this one left me with so many questions!, This book gave me all the feels, the audiobook is absolute perfection! I loved every second of the narrator, especially Luna who had me in fits of giggles. I loved the growth of Harry into this book, he was really figuring out his identity and him talking back to Snape had me pausing the book to laugh out loud. Fleur and Tonks played a prominent, unexpected role in this book and I loved it. They were a welcomed surprise that add the drama, somber, and hilarity to numerous chapters. \\n I also loved the relationships in this chapter, to see Dumbledore show affection towards Harry had my heart filling with warm, fuzzy feels. Then Harry and Ginny...DEAD, I died and was stunned, excited, and cheering! Ron and Hermione are still tip toeing around each other but Hermione\\'s level of petty in this book was praise worthy, she was a sly, green-eyed monster. The ending gutted me, for obvious reasons and my heart will need some time to recover prior to diving into the final audiobook in the series but overall I was in love with the character progression, growth, and determination. I finished the audiobook in a short amount of time because I simply couldn\\'t stop listening, my favorite book in the series so far!, Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n I cannot review HP but this I can do. \\n Image in big size. \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect \\n Perfect, So sad. I thought Sirius\\'s death was sad but the death in this book was even worse. I enjoyed the book but the ending was just depressing., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I liked the fact that we get to see Harry as a later-year goer of Hogwarts. He\\'s clearly grown up - from being captain of the Quidditch team to dating Ginny Weasely. This is perhaps the most tightly wound of all the books, that which contains the most plot and both answers and sets up so many questions, resolves and promises almost too much. But as with the rest of the series, Rowling does it with a master\\'s gentle touch and makes it seem almost as effortless as breathing., No words needed. 5+ stars., Amazing book with a lot of mystry rvealed about voldemort dY~~, DAMN YOU ALL SNAPE LOVERS I SERIOUSLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU!, Harry Potter was a petulant teenager in this book. Consequently I wasnt as mesmorised as with the others. Probably the worst of the 7 if you ask me., This is probably my favorite book of them all!, The war against Voldemort is not going well; even Muggle governments are noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of the Daily Prophet, looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. \\n And yet... \\n As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate -- and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. \\n So it\\'s the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here at Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort -- and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability., *Re-read* I love Harry Potter! Always makes me sad when Dumbledore dies though :(, \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one that rises against them and strikes back!\", Mi favorito despues de el Prisionero de Azkaban . \\n Conocer mas sobre la historia de Voldemort fue algo que me gusto mucho y siento que nos da muchas explicaciones y pistas sobre el septimo y ultimo libro de Harry Potter., 2/21/2012 \\n Dec 16, 2013 \\n May 10, 2015, READING THIS BOOK WAS LIKE THROWING A THOUSAND NEEDLES TO MY HEART, Horcruxes !!!!!! :) read to find our what they are!, I\\'m not crying; YOU\\'RE crying!, After \"order of the Phoenix\", rowling finds some better inspiration and dome good twist to the whole story. This is the bast of the latter Potter novels., I wish I was writing this review before having already read book number 7. Just to be able to remember the feelings the book made me have for Snape, but I\\'m not saying anything more just in case you\\'re among the few lucky that still have a Harry Potter left to read for the first time. \\n However, my general mood about this book has not changed through the years... I feel book number 6 is a very long introduction to the epilogue of the saga in book number 7. It doesn\\'t have the tension of neither book 5, 7 or 4. \\n The best parts are the beginning and the end, i.e. the parts that don\\'t take place at Hogwarts, or that are not related to school in the more general sense of the term. \\n That being said, this is still a Harry Potter, and even if it is not one of my favorites, it\\'s still a world class book. Glad you won\\'t experience the pang of disappointment at the end of it because you feel you needed more, as, lucky you, book 7 is already out there and you\\'ll not have to wait a whole year or two as I had to back then., Co the day se la tap minh thich nhat trong toan bo series :), I actually read this when I was small but now I couldn\\'t remember anything so I re-read it. \\n It was actually fantastic. Like all the past Harry Potter books, I gave it four stars. Why? It\\'s because I rarely give out five stars. I mean I don\\'t even recall giving a book one. \\n The reason I think this book was and is fantastic is because it focused on a different aspect of magic. I love how every little mystery is answered in the end. \\n And besides, Draco had a huge part in here, I\\'m so glad to be reading these books finally. But I\\'m terrified of ending the series though. Then it\\'ll really be over for me. It\\'s been over for everyone else for so long. But I feel like it\\'s only just started for me, and I haven\\'t had enough time to savor the story. I don\\'t reread things as much now as I used to. But I\\'m loving this series now that everything is happening. Really, I\\'m just so glad there\\'s kissing now. Why did it take so long for there to be kissing? Okay, because they were babies. That\\'s a good reason. But geez, I like a little romance with my almost dying all the time. Anyway, I\\'m in love. I\\'ve been heartbroken. I know certain things are going to happen because I watched th movies one time years ago. But I never remember when they happen or how. So I\\'m been constantly surprised and gutted by the big reveals and betrayals and whatnot. It\\'s been a great rollercoaster. I\\'m already starting HP7, so I don\\'t really have time to give this more of a review. I\\'ve got to get listening., I absolutely loved this book. It reaches out and grasps your heartstrings and refuses to let go even after the last page has been read. You find yourself in each and every character in one way or another, no matter who they may be. It may be their bravery, their shyness, the way they\\'re mad at the world that has so wronged them. Or it may be their loyalty that you resonate with, their strength. Regardless, there is someone. \\n So many new relationships are forged in this book. Friendships strengthened, love blossoms, it is truly a masterpiece. But that\\'s nothing new coming from Rowling, honestly. This book was no exception. From the first few chapters you find yourself on the edge of your seat, biting your nails wondering what will happen next. You\\'re outraged with the characters, you cry with them, feel with them. You can\\'t not. Some scenes warm your heart, whereas others tear it apart without mercy. Regardless, this book was great. Of course. \\n Rating: 5/5, 4.5 \\n Right now, my whole thoughts on this book is a whole bunch of swear words \\n WHY WHY WHY, ** spoiler alert ** \\n Ok--I have to admit it--I sobbed openly when Dumbledore died. The detail of this story is amazing, especially when you go back and re-read the series. J.K. Rowling ties so many things together in this artful tale. I find something new every time I revisit these old friends., Why would you do this to my poor heart, Joanne Rowling WHY WOULD YOU??? \\n This hurt even more than the first time., 2016 reread, My feelings on the sixth Harry Potter novel are somewhat mixed. I like the book even if it can\\'t really stand alone on its own merits. I like the more obvious fallability of Dumbledore. I like that Harry\\'s continuing to step up to the plate as things fall apart around him. \\n Lost in the whole \"WTF Snape\" craziness, however, is the continuing backstories of many of the characters. I start to wonder whether the absurd lengths of the fifth and sixth books lend themselves more to being able to tell the stories that Rowling wasn\\'t allowed to in the first three - reading about how Snape is so underutilised in some of the earlier books gets me thinking about what might have been left out, forcing Rowling to play catch-up. \\n Unfortunately, it\\'s hard to talk about book six without discussing book seven. Having not read book seven, it\\'s hard to go much further with it. The loose ends make for great suspense, but tough thinking. What\\'s impressive about book six, though, is that the final scene following Harry and Dumbledore\\'s return from the cave moves very quickly. For all of Rowling\\'s faults as an author (and she has them), she knows how to write an action scene, and the buildup in Dumbledore\\'s office is nearly as great as the battle in the Ministry of Magic in book five. \\n That buildup is what\\'s got me excited about book seven., This one is truly the end of Harry\\'s innocent years., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Parang eto ang pinakasad sa lahat ng HP books. Sunod-sunod na kase ang mga masasamang nangyayare tas palaki na ng palaki ang problema. Pero pinapakita pa din dito ang kagandahan ng hope. Nakakapanghinayang kase yung iba alam ko na mga nangyayare. Sobrang ganda sana kung di ko lam na magkakatuluyan si Harry at Ginny, na mamamatay si Dumbledore at si Snape pa ang pumatay. Wala na yung element of surprise. Sayang. Simulan ko na mamya yung Deathly Hallows. Medyo may idea na din ako kung anong mangyayare. Ah ah nakakasura., bagus banget... \\n jk nggak takut mematikan karakter yang super hero... \\n padahal biasanya dalam komik fantasi, jagoan selalu menang^_^, As good as any Harry Potter book. This story is getting darker and better towards the end. And main characters are dying, which is really good for a change. As it usually happens in this series, it ended in a cliffhanger. Cant wait to read the next one. Wonder what\\'s the final nail in the coffin would be.., #39 A book with magic \\n No hay palabras correctas. \\n Adios Dumbledore. Todos te extranos., Okay, so I am now deep into the part of this tale that I have not seen on film. And once I am done reading this, I intend to watch the series just because. That said, I was mildly disappointed in some of the aspects of this story. Caution...there may be SPOILERS AHEAD. \\n My biggest issue was with the cast of supporting characters NOT believing Harry when it came to Malfoy and some of the issues going on within the school.. Okay, I can be alright with Dumbledore having his reasons. He has a big picture and therefore, he may not have wanted to upset the plan he had in motion. However, Hermoine and Ron should have known better. They have seen all the stuff around their friend. To be so dismissive did not ring entirely true. Also, even the writing makes it hard to really be convinced that Snape is a bad guy. He could have killed Harry in the duel...Harry should be aware of that instead of becoming more set in his mind, not to mention what he has seen regarding his own father\\'s past treatment of the man. Harry is not stupid and seems to be able to analyze everything EXCEPT that. Granted, if Snape turns out (in book 7) to be the evil person Harry is convinced that he is, then so much for my argument regarding that point. \\n Overall, there is a lot going on here and the story is moving along well. Looking forward to the conclusion., Genia J.K., Like the others in the series, amazingly thought out and well worth the wait. Interesting views into the history of the characters., I finished this book this afternoon with tears in my eyes. It took me just under two days to finish because I couldn\\'t put it down. From the beginning to the end, Rowling wrote her book beautifully. \\n Characters such as Harry and his friends, continued to develop and grow and mature. Harry\\'s relationship with Dumbledore also developed as he became more than just a head master to Harry, but a friend too. This made the ending that much more emotional. \\n The storyline was also interesting and amazing. In a couple of the books in the series, I feel like not much happens in the beginning and middle of the book, but everything unfolds at the end. However The Half Blood Prince is intriguing throughout which made the entire book that much better. \\n I would definitely recommend reading the Harry Potter series specifically for this book. \\n I\\'m going to go watch the movie now! Wish me luck xx, I knew what was going to happen i still cried i just dont understand why anyone has to die, Wonderful.., So Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is my least favorite HP movie, so I was pleasantly surprised that the book is a lot better. Even though, I kinda missed the whole deatheaters scene at the Burrow during Christmas, it was still way better. I throughly enjoyed this!, as i keep saying its really hard to review this book series because i am just that obsessed with it! thats all that i really have to say about it., This is not my favorite Harry Potter book, but considering that they have all been re-read several times, I can promise you that it still ranks among my most beloved books. \\n To me, this is where the darkness in the series really takes hold. With Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the darkness was there and getting stronger, but it wasn\\'t seeping into every facet of Harry\\'s life. \\n J. K. Rowling brings her magical world back again for this sixth book, and though it has been described in every book before in the series, it is still just as magical as the first time Harry stepped through the magical barrier and into Diagon Alley. \\n This book and the entire series are a refreshing view on fantasy and magic, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone teenage and older., It makes me cry. I love Snape so much and I am very sure from the start that he is the Half blood prince.. Best par of the book is Harry become the best student in potion! LOL..., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Amazing!! I wasn\\'t as emotional when dumbledore died because I knew he had to either way. It was a spectacular read and I loved the jealous Ron and Hermione scenes. The biggest difference I see in the books against the movies is that they still have that warm and cosy feeling that the movies lack. The movies get darker and darker., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Wow. Just wow. What an amazing book. Dumbledore\\'s death made such a big impact I can\\'t believe it even happened. I\\'m awestruck., Vaya historia, la segui paso a paso, minuto a minuto, me estremeci y finalmente llego el descubrimiento del secreto de quien era The Half-Blood Prince, quien se lo hubiera imaginado., ., Book four had been my favorite book so far in the series , but not any more. Even though I knew what was going to hapoen from seeing the movie , the book was still an emotional punch in the gut. I quite enjoyed the fleshing out of Lord Voldemorts backstory throughout the book., This really is one of the best books in the series. I love Voldemorts back story and I love that Harry gets to spend so much more time with Dumbledore before we lose him :(, I can\\'t believe Snape killed Dumbledore., Excellent book that I would highly recommend to anyone. That is if there\\'s anyone left who hasn\\'t read it., (adult reread of series) \\n wow this was much better than i remembered and has become my new favorite of the series. One more reread to go!, Obviously a re-read, this time in english. Looooooooved it even more, if that is possible., For the young adult series, I would wager that this book is probably the best out of the series (haven\\'t read the last one yet), though the last two chapters are slow, trudging, and a snore. It seems to me that Rowling may have had a little help constructing the layout of the story., Dear Lord, this book reeked. I know everyone on the Earth read it. I was so excited waiting for the mailman to deliver it when it came out. \\n It was 300 or so pages too long. I half-expected Harry Potter to start reading a Harry Potter book because there was so much internal advertising about plots from the other Harry Potter books. \\n That said, I still bought and read the last one in the first weekend. (Much better, thought I.), At this point I start to get frustrated with Harry\\'s bad attitude and teenage angst. He\\'s always shouting at people and being rude and has gotten quite obsessive and sure of himself when it comes to figuring out what the bad guys are up to. He doesn\\'t like to listen to his friends anymore and thinks he knows better than everyone else, Dumbledore included. That being said, I still like this book and it\\'s exciting to see some direct action being taken to sort out You-Know-Who. The end still always makes me cry, and this time around I can\\'t help but feel more sorry for Draco and Snape. I can\\'t imagine being in their situations and being called cowardly on top of it by some bratty ungrateful teenager who has no clue about what you\\'ve had to sacrifice for him and others. Ah well. This might be one of the last times I re-read the series. As I get older I find I have much less patience for Harry\\'s moody teenage antics., Goodness gracious. \\n JK Rowling, what are you trying to do to us?! \\n I don\\'t want to write a long review or spoil anything, but it was a good book. Dumbledore and Harry got closer, and Dumbledore became another father figure of Harry\\'s. Why do all the father figures die?! I\\'m going to miss Dumbledore so much, he was one of my favorite characters. \\n JK Rowling added more romance than there were in the previous novels. All the ships start to come up and I love all of them. Unlike other books, where romance and action are basically the plot, the romance was prominent and noticeable without drawing away from the action. \\n It was really good and I liked it. Can\\'t wait to finish the series!, Reread October 12th, 2016 \\n Definitely one of my new favorites in the series, but also very heartbreaking., Super!, This novel is a breathless ride, from the first couple of sequences involving the Muggle Prime Minister and then Snape performing a mysterious Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa Malfoy to the heartbreaking funeral of one of my favourite characters. \\n It seems as though Rowling has achieved once again the tight plotting and exciting storyline that she managed in the Prisoner of Azkaban - this sixth book in the series is by far the best since that highlight. \\n Here we explore a great deal of Voldemort\\'s back story through the use of memories that Dumbledore has collected from various people who had dealings with the Dark Lord. I loved delving into the why of Voldemort and how he became the pale and snakelike creature he now is from starting out as Tom Riddle. \\n As well as this, Rowling introduces the idea of Horcruxes - unlike some of the other items she has introduced into previous books just to fulfil some specific use, the Horcrux is much more than this and pulls together the plotlines that have gone before (e.g. the diary of the second novel). I enjoyed how Harry had to pursue Professor Slughorn in order to gain the final memory that would reveal Voldemort\\'s plans. \\n Slughorn was an interesting addition to the cast of characters - a genial and rather shallow man, weak and somewhat cowardly. His arrival allowed Snape to finally take on the role of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and pushed Harry into taking Potions and thereby discovering the textbook that was once owned by the Half-Blood Prince of the title. \\n I adored the fact that Hermione was deeply jealous of Harry\\'s newfound ability in Potions. I also liked the way that Harry used the notations of the Prince in his textbook - although this lead to one rather nasty and gruesome moment. \\n In fact, this book is heavy on the nasty events. It is emphasised how much the wizarding world has changed and grown more distrustful. Some pupils are no longer allowed to attend Hogwarts; each day Hermione scans the Daily Prophet to see who has died; and there are gory moments in the plot (such as when Draco and Harry face off against each other). \\n There are many moments that make this book one of the best in the series. For instance, I deeply appreciated the beautiful touch of Dumbledore saying, at the start of the book, that Harry would be safe because he was with Dumbledore - and then at the end of the book, Dumbledore says that he knows he will be alright because he is with Harry. It is a very poignant moment and reveals the deep feelings of love and respect that Dumbledore has for Harry. \\n I enjoyed finding out why Tonks\\' appearance and Patronus had changed, and I rejoiced when Harry and Ginny finally came together. Another paragraph that had me close to tears was when Harry realised that Luna and Neville were the only two members of the DA who had responded to Hermione\\'s summons - very moving and honest. \\n Once again, the gloom of the book is disappated somewhat by some comedy moments - these included the Apparation lessons and test, and Ron\\'s whole relationship with Lavender (pure comedy gold at times - Won Won!) \\n This book is excellent - thrilling and emotional in equal measure. And I defy anyone not to feel a tremendous sense of loss when they realise that the seventh book will not include Hogwarts, by now a character in its own right. I look forward immensely to the climax of the Harry Potter series., 4 stars. The triumphant return of great Harry Potter storytelling! Loved this book! Very dark, and great secrets of Voldemort revealed!, I read this book with some distrust, I confess. The first books had a kind of naivety and passion that I enjoyed read, although they were clearly children\\'s books or juveniles targeted. But, sequel after sequel they became passionless and lost their initial glow. \\n This one was simply boring and kind of stupid. Most of the book is about the search for memories and, in truth, they add nothing that Dumbledore didn\\'t know before. So much trouble for nothing. \\n In reality, it was so weak that I even give up on reading he next one. \\n For kids, I suppose its okay. They\\'ll enjoy it. Mine did., Reread: 04/08/16, Very emotional ending, book gets better the more you read..., Very interesting book. This book is my favorite in the series thus far. Twists, turns, and surprises abound., So far, #3 and #6 are my favorites of the series. I\\'m glad that Harry got a little less whiny in this one than he was in #5., like it., As the Harry Potter series has progressed, each book has gotten a slightly darker theme - meaning these are no longer books really suitable for young children, in my opinion. \\n However, the theme started in the very first book still carries through here: Harry, cursed by powerful Dark magic as a baby, discovers that he is indeed the one to resolve the current evil, or die trying. While at times the storyline moves a bit slowly, Rowling flushes out more elements of the story; most of this additional development is crucial to seeing exactly how Harry develops into the wizard he is and the hero he is to be., I love re reading Harry Potter, this broke my heart. Still love it, I read this whole book on the plane on my way to China. This was an excellent way to kill 12 hours!, THIS.BOOK. All my friends told me to read this series but they all failed to mention it would make me an EMOTIONAL WRECK., For those of you who have read this book, you understand why, not an hour after finishing I am having a hard time writing a review. Let me say that this really is close to the top of the list in the series for me. It does not stand alone as a story as much as, say, Prisoner of Azkaban. But the writing was so much better than Order of the Phoenix and the characters more likable. This is partially possible because the \\'kids\\' enter an age of less teenage angst, but also possible because Rowling wasnt as constrained (I can\\'t believe I am about to say this) by a novels-plot...she was only bound to advance the plot of the whole series. Perhaps with this she was able to leave aside some of the details included in the Order of the Phoenix that I felt added length...but not necessarily strength. I enjoyed this book a lot and couldn\\'t avoid reading book 7 in short order if I tried., Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone 5* \\n Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets 4* \\n Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 4* \\n Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire 4* \\n Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix 5* \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince 5* \\n Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 5*, YO BEST ONE YET, I don\\'t have words right now., This was my first harry potter book. I choose to start here just because I finished seeing the latest movie and always wanted to try out Rowling. So I did... \\n This is also the first time I see a movie prior to reading the book. \\n I must say that I don\\'t find her writing all that appealing. OK! It\\'s nice, a good story, but seems to lack depth (don\\'t know if the previous books had more depth). If i didn\\'t see the previous movies, I would find that she lacks descriptions of the character (I suppose they were on the previous books) and place (the same). \\n All in all i did enjoy it and my review is positive., This book is maddening, especially when you know exactly what\\'s going on. Every time I read it I just wish someone would take Harry seriously and the whole tragedy could be averted. But then I remember that it\\'s not so much a tragedy as a highly calculated plan by BAMF Dumbledore. Still, I remember the shock I felt the first time I read this book. I didn\\'t really believe it at first like so many others. It\\'s so good, whether it\\'s your first time through or not. And it\\'s a whole heck of a lot better than OotP., When you think that J.K.Rolling cannot add anymore to this magical world yet she surprise you once again! \\n review of the story will be completed when I finish the seventh book. \\n Absolutely brilliant!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n 2016- \\n what a way of starting the new year!!! i love this book, so sad yet so funny and wonderful at the same time. i missed book ginny very very much and i love her relationship with harry in this book. knowing what was going to happen, i thought i was prepared but to be completely honest i still cried a bunch. let\\'s see how i feel upon re reading the next book this time around, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I may have given it five stars, but don\\'t misinterpret that rating. I disliked this book a whole heck of a lot. RIP Albus Dumbledore, I owe everything I am today to the Harry Potter series. If it wasn\\'t for these books I wouldn\\'t be the person I am today., Another solid Potter novel. The Tom Riddle material is dark and excellent, though I wish there had been even more of it., I can\\'t...I just can\\'t. This book left me incapable of doing anything but curling up in my bed and bawling my eyes out. I think this is the book I loved as well as hated the most in the series. I don\\'t know what else to say..., Cruel book, I think that this is the most weak book of the saga, maybe in the end raise the media of the book. Because the saga is amazing, I love it anyway., I almost gave this book four stars again, but I can\\'t quite bring myself to do it. This is my least favorite book of series, but it still gripped me cover to cover. The main reason for my relative dislike is that not much happens in the book until the last third/half, though the ending is incredible. \\n I do not like Ginny in the movies: she comes off as flat and uninteresting. In the books (especially this one), however, she is witty and works well with Harry. She is just as much a prankster as Fred and George, and though their reputation overshadows her, she is confident in who she is and just does whatever she wants. \\n In the movies, Slughorn is perfectly depicted. Narcissa Malfoy should have been more ruthless. I wish Voldemort\\'s eyes had been red. \\n Previous rating: in late 2009/early 2010, I read this book before the Order of the Phoenix on accident, and I was not able to put it down. It was so good, and I went through an emotional rollercoaster ride, and I just want to say, how I believe this is my favorite one thus far. I read it while I was watching the last three movies and I think this book is a book I will not be able to leave anywhere but in my heart., Awesome!, re-read 4/2016, I have to continue to give all the Harry Potter books five stars because I really do love them so much. I think, if I had to choose, this would be my least favorite book. Of course, there is a very major character death, so that is part of the reason. But I also just felt the book was a lot of words to tell what could have been a shorter story. Getting the memories was interesting, but it actually wasn\\'t very essential, since Dumbledore had already suspected all along what Voldemort had done. The last main scene where they go to get the horcrux left me feeling a little dissatisfied. It just didn\\'t seem to all add up and make sense, something Rowling is generally very good at doing. Finding out who the \"half blood prince\" actually was, also a bit anticlimatic. \\n Major Spoilers Below: \\n Since I know what happens in the last book, and that Severus actually killed Dumbledore by his actual request, I am really disappointed by this part of the book. It is out of character for Dumbledore to actually basically commit suicide, even if he had reasons for it. To allow Snape to do the deed was also out of character. Dumbledore would not have wanted that type of thing on anyone\\'s conscience and have it follow them all their lives. I understand that he was protecting Malfoy and giving Harry his chance to fulfill his destiny and the prophecy, I just think it could have been accomplished in a different way. I am not writer, so I don\\'t have any suggestions. I feel that Rowling wraps up so many loose ends by the end of the series, but this action is just unexplainable to me., Almost done with my series re-read!, So sad..., My least favorite book in the series. Although Rowling\\'s writing and the wizarding world is as enjoyable as always, HBP is over-long and with not much plot; it\\'s basically a place-holder in the series., Gosh, this made me have soo many feels. I cried, laugh, smiled, and ugh... just so amazing. Definitely a step up from the last book, and was amazingly written. Just go and read it, go. i\\'m just.. leave me in a corner to cry...., dY~-dY~deg, I love Harry Potter, but I don\\'t like Snape., Amazing. I just couldn\\'t wait to read the next one after this book ended. Another sad book, but packed with information for the 7th installment. Wonderful 10/10, Finished listening on audible. Loved it this time around too!, Why?!?!? It is interesting to reread these books as adults. Rowling layers in feminist, antiracist, and deeply moving interpretations of love and its power., Forced to finally admit that Voldemort is back and again on the rise to power, the Ministry of Magic and the magical world are in an uproar. The magical community is finally starting to side with Harry and Dumbledore, at last believing that things are in disarray, and acting accordingly. But school must go on for Harry and Co., and while there are no O.W.L.s looming, classes are still as demanding as ever. Add to that Harry\\'s private lessons with Dumbledore, where he learns as much as he possibly can about his arch-nemesis in preparation for their epic prophesied showdown, and an altogether new Potions situation, and it\\'s all the Chosen One can do to keep it together, never realizing what dreadful and horrific events await at the end of the year. \\n Seven years since the last book came out, I decided it was finally time for my 6th (I though it was 7th, alas) read-through, and my first time all the way through from start to finish. I think with these I\\'ll start by writing what I can remember about my initial thoughts and then review them properly. \\n 9 YEARS AGO: Again, this book\\'s release was a most exciting and eagerly-anticipated event for me and my sister, and the bookstore midnight party (at which my artwork was featured) only increased our excitement. At the time this book affected me even more than OotP did, just with what happened, and how it happened. I loved how the kids were growing up, it was hard to find fault with the story, and at a certain point I felt I had to put the book physically down and take a moment to process what in the wizarding world had just happened. \\n THIS YEAR: After all these years I can look at this book objectively and say that it\\'s not among my favorites. It has a LOT of great things going for it, and it has plenty of drama and thrills and humor, but there\\'s something about it that feels kind of like an in-between story, like it\\'s just marking time and dropping information before the final chapter (which I guess it is, though I don\\'t think it HAS to feel that way). As usual, the storytelling is compelling and there\\'s some vivid descriptions of new characters and settings, and the characters are in top form, though evolving as people do when they stop being children and start growing toward adulthood. This is by far the steamiest book in the series, with much more emphasis on romance (read: hormones) and dating than ever before, which is natural, and which doesn\\'t really seem to distract from the overall plot, in fact it rather enhances it. Sure, some of the kids break character now and then, but I think that happens in real life when young people start to notice and attract/be attracted to those of the opposite sex. One of the great things about this book is that Ginny finally starts to come into her own. She started to show some spirit in the fifth book, but this is when she really emerges as a force to be reckoned with. I feel like the tent-pole scenes with Harry and Dumbledore in the Pensieve are placed just right and given just the right amount of attention, revealing plenty of intriguing clues and information about Voldemort\\'s past without dragging on. I really like how much it starts to tie in so many things from previous books, especially CoS, and adds a lot of little touches that make the whole thing seem really cohesive (whether those touches were planned during the writing of the earlier books or not). It starts to give the series a real feeling of cohesion with bookend elements. There are a few well-placed twists (new DADA teacher??), and though the mystery itself isn\\'t as engaging as some in previous books (eurgh, too much Snape), but it keeps the story moving along and adds some nice drama. Some parts drive me a little crazy (like the continued complete ineptitude of the Ministry and how the lead-up to the finale basically ends up meaning nothing, and also of course how Dumbledore is incredibly presumptuous and still unnecessarily secretive, and of course Snape), but it continues the mood established in the fifth book and builds up nicely to what we could only have guessed would be the most glorious and satisfying finale in all history of literature. (Was it?... Stay tuned to find out.) \\n In the end, this book is a lot about Snape, and I really don\\'t like Snape. It\\'s also a lot about Voldemort, who I also don\\'t love, but I guess it\\'s pretty important to find out stuff about him. This one feels sort of like a rest stop in the series, but it does a good job of bridging the fifth book and the finale, while our favorite magical now-definitely-teenagers continue to weave their way through the winding walkways of life and learning and (oh yes) love., This book is fantastic and should be read no matter what. Such a sad book to. Read it!, LOVE IT!!!! J.K. Rowling once again is amazing, I just love this series so much. It\\'s always good to return to Hogwarts and this book as well as the 5th made me feel so much. \\n I\\'m really sobbing because of the end but really excited about reading the 7th book again., Amazing and fun!, This is an excellent series and although I am not a fantasy reader I did read all of them before seeing the movies. I also preferred the books over the movies. However this is a series that is best when read from first to last in order., march 2014: just reread. one of the best things about book 6 is that harry is not the annoying, moody boy of book 5. i also like that we learn a lot more about a lot of characters outside of the main trio. \\n surprises: \\n - this book reminded me that ginny is much more awesome in the books than in the movies. but i\\'m not sure that i understand what a bat-bogey hex is... to boogers with bat wings fly at you? \\n - the possibility that voldemort actually cursed the defense against the dark arts position when he was denied it. \\n - i love that arthur weasley\\'s dearest ambition is to figure out how airplanes stay up., This is my favorite of the books so far. This was such a great installment into the Harry book series and I can\\'t wait for the last book but I\\'m also terrified., This was the first book I ever read twice. I had to read it again right before I got the last book., Relative to Books 3, 4, and 5, Book 6 doesn\\'t contain a lot of action. Rather, there is a wealth of conversation, of human connection (and disconnection), of uncertainty and, most importantly, revelation. I certainly don\\'t mean any of this in a negative way - I was halfway through the book before I knew it, gobbling up the exquisite plotting and story. So many layers of subterfuge and distrust and confusion were sown throughout, many coming to a head, others only beginning to see the light of day, saving themselves for that final chapter in the series. Harry and the reader together learn many fascinating and mysterious things over the course of the book, and the dearth of action does not seem so great a burden, lulled as we are into the realm of discovery and understanding, before everything ultimately implodes in more than one gripping, astonishing, unbelievable burst at the end. \\n I wrote in my review of Book 5 that Harry finally experienced consequences for his actions. In this entry, he progresses even further down the path to adulthood by learning that there is always something below the surface, that he is not protected, that he can be at once right and terribly wrong. (However, he still hasn\\'t learned to give more credence to Hermione\\'s theories, which would\\'ve saved him some trouble.) He also discovers, somewhat to his surprise, that despite all he has lost, he still has his friends. His childhood now decisively over, Harry faces his uncertain future with the boldness and bravery of Gryffindor - and with both love and hate in his heart., My heart strings were ripped out. So sad., It\\'s Harry Potter.. what more do I need to say?, 4.5 stars. Reread. I enjoyed this so much more than the movie which is the one I dislike the most of all the films!! I still enjoy all the extra details we get about Hogwarts and the schooling life, those are my favourite parts!! The teenage drama was so good, I immensely enjoyed it all!! Now onto the final book. . ., 5 stars obviously. It\\'s Harry Potter., I can see why so many people are obsessed with this series a decade after reading it. You have the major story arcs that make up the best stories (coming of age, call to adventure, good vs. evil) and it is done in an original way. Harry Potter is not as perfect as he is portrayed in the movies. The books are able to express subtle parts of growing up, including how HP is developing as a person. How he is reacting to the unfortunate events that seem to follow the boy who lived. \\n The half blood prince really tests Harry and shows the temptation of short-cuts. It also beautifully dealt with the choice he has to make in growing up. He is a school aged boy and his world has been split between Hogwarts and battling Voldemort. I enjoyed watching him stumble through and find his way. It is what I enjoy most about these books. \\n On to the last one..., I usually take a little break between each Harry Potter book, to contemplate things for a bit. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be able to with this one. Goodness, I feel for those who had to wait a whole year after this ending... \\n Overall, I liked this a lot more than the previous installment. I enjoyed the mostly slower pace, and seeing more interaction with Dumbledore. I did think that the title (and reveal of the Prince\\'s identity) was ultimately a bit anti-climactic. I\\'m not sure if it was supposed to be a red herring and I was supposed to think it was someone else or what. Oh well., Very Beautifully written!, I don\\'t know, after book 4 it just seemed to me that J.K. Rowling didn\\'t enjoy writing any more. The plot feels forced and heavy. \\n Also, why did Harry\\'s dad had to be such a bully? That he wasn\\'t perfect, sure, but as he is discribed here you just can\\'t like him anymore., absolutely loved it!!! definitely my favorite!!! so many answers!!!, spectacular., Oh my goodness. I definitely never read this one on my first read when these books were all released. If I did, I 100% do not remember anything that happened in this book. I feel that this was the most intense one of the series so far. Can\\'t wait to read the last one!, Fun fantasy for those who don\\'t know there\\'s a lot of better fantasy writers out there. Rowlings is great at plotting, but her characterizations are often one-dimensional and with the kids awfully arrested in their development, but I will read Book 7, which is the true test of any good writer., Forever 5 out of 5 stars. No matter how many times I read this one, it still breaks my heart every time!, I didn\\'t realize how much I\\'d forgotten since my last reading. I\\'m not sure I\\'d read HBP since I finished Deathly Hallows for the first time. Rereading with the full knowledge of the series is a vastly different experience., Year six at Hogwarts brings some unexpected twists and turns. Harry\\'s NEWT courses are harder than ever and his added lessons with Dumbledore to uncover Voldemorts past can sometimes be more than he bargained for. On top of this is the monster inside him that has recently taken notice of Ginny, Ron\\'s little sister, and romance has finally hit Hogwarts. \\n In many ways Half Blood Prince accomplishes everything that Chamber of Secrets doesn\\'t. It succeeds in getting Harry to notice Ginny, helps Ron to grow up and Hermione to acknowledge her feelings, and explains a multitude of things about Tom Riddles(Voldy\\'s) past that connect directly with Chamber. All in all, Half Blood Prince is about characters, and if you\\'ve been following this blog at all, you\\'ll know that\\'s pretty important to me. \\n Overall, I find Half Blood Prince to be one of my favorites. This may be because it is also one of Harry\\'s best years at Hogwarts. Until the very end, his biggest problems consist of choosing a Quidditch team and dealing with the \"monster inside\" of him whenever he see\\'s Ginny. I\\'m also a big fan of the romantic aspects of this book, as they had been pretty sparse in the proceeding five, and I feel like it really rounded out the series. \\n The other thing I love in Half Blood Prince are Harry\\'s lessons with Dumbledore. Diving into various peoples memories can be fun, and helps to add new scenery to the typical Hogwarts sets. Oh, and did I mention that Voldy\\'s back story is actually pretty interesting? Love potions, death, antiques. It\\'s pretty cool stuff. \\n Half Blood Prince is the perfect set up for the final book in the series, Deathly Hallows. If you\\'re one of those people who\\'s been reading the books out of order, or using the movies as supplements, this is not the one to skip., Intense and sad, we delve further into Harry\\'s adolescence. Finally, Harry is forced to realize that this journey is his to complete... and the courage he must embrace in the face of terrifying odds., I feel like this is a Harry Potter book that I know least well. I\\'m sure I\\'ve read it is many times so we read the others but I just feel like I don\\'t know the story of the characters involved in the same way as I do with the other books. Maybe that\\'s because I haven\\'t seen the film many times, in fact I think I\\'ve only seen it twice, or maybe it\\'s that this book just feel very different. For me this book is like an onion, and as much as it hurts me to quote Shrek, it has many layers to peel back and to investigate. \\n I like the in-depth analysis into what makes Voldemort tick. I like finding more about his past and how this is shaped the very situation that are well known characters find themselves in. Most of all, I like changing pace and feel. The characters really feel like they\\'re coming of age, like they\\'re old enough to understand what\\'s going on I might actually now have the tools and the life experience to battle everything they\\'re going to face., I STILL HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS. SUCH A GOOD SET UP FOR BOOK 7!!! 3, Hands down my favourite so far...although I expected it as I saw the movie...when those feels hit you...damn..., No voy a superar esto pronto..., I enjoyed this more than I thought I would at the beginning. I cannot believe that I only have one more book to go, as I feel that there is still so much unresolved! I am also astonished that no one has ruined anything for me yet, and this particular book was full of surprises. I am still shocked over the last two chapters., Quite the book., My reaction after finishing the book: \\n WHAT!?!?!?, The penultimate novel of Harry Potter\\'s saga distils darkness for all its four sides. At this point of the plot, J.K. Rowling uses all her vast resources as a writer to plunge into a darker and much more mature story, preparing the reader for the final climax in which the famous magician will face life and death with his archenemy \"Lord Valdemort\". For sure is a must for all Harry Potter fans, and a great recommendation for the rest of readers that hasn\\'t discovered the famous magician story yet. \\n Spanish version: \\n La penultima novela de la saga de Harry Potter destila oscuridad por todos sus cuatro costados. Llegados a este punto de la saga, J. K. Rowling utiliza todos sus grandes recursos de escritora para sumergirnos en una historia cada vez mas asfixiante, tenebrosa y sobretodo madura, preparando al lector para el climax final en el que el famoso mago debera enfrentarse a vida o muerte con su archienemigo \"Lord Valdemort\". Por supuesto es imprescindible para todos los fans de Harry Potter, y una gran recomendacion para el resto de lectores que aun no han leido la historia del famoso mago., And thus begins the most disheartening \"beginning of the end.\" \\n I hate to admit that I never read this book when the series was released; this was my loss because this book is outstanding. The intricacy of the plot is admirable in and of itself, but this book also sets the seventh book up perfectly, all while continuing critical character and story development. There was so much backstory I missed with the sixth movie, so I was so glad to get it in the book -- particularly Voldemort\\'s history. And speaking of, this book certainly keeps in line with the pattern of the series becoming progressively darker; in the Half-Blood Prince readers are thrust into increasingly dismal and tragic territory. I was crying by the end of it. \\n I think this book may be competing for a top slot in my rankings... \\n P.S. I fully recognize that at this point that virtually everyone has read this series and has their own opinions. My reviews on these books aren\\'t intended to add anything new to the discussion; they\\'re largely for my own reference, so I can remember which aspects of which books I enjoyed :), It had not happened . . . It could not have happened. . . \\n *shocked* \\n My heart is broken, once again. \\n You have no idea how I lived through this book. \\n Amazing. . . Too many feelings. . . \\n Cant wait to start the last book. . ., Um dos melhores livros de HP ;), This is the second time I read the sixth book in the Harry Potter series, but definitely feels like reading it the first time. All the mystery, the romance, the jealousy and the confusion are all there. I still get the emotions I got from reading this book for the first time, and it gets better I think. \\n This book tells more about Lord Voldermort\\'s past, in order for Harry to learn on how to kill him, as foretold in the prophecy. Harry is in his sixth year at Hogwarts, and is getting more mature. And I also think that in preparation for the seventh and final book this book is getting more darker, which makes it even more interesting. \\n I can\\'t wait to read the seventh and final book in the series.., Just read it for the second time. I loved it., This is my favorite of the Harry Potter series. In this book were are introduced to Severus Snape as a rounded character. We learn about Snape in a very real, personal way. In my opinion, the Potter series is about Snape, the choices HE made, and the consequences. The Deathly Hollows is almost anti-climactic after reading this book., THE FEELS!! Oh my god, Dumbledore! It\\'s such a great book, I can\\'t find the right words to describe what I\\'m feeling right now., Reread Dec 31st, 2016 - bumped up to 5 stars because Harry Potter, As sad as the last few chapters are, this has to be my top fav., I love the detail that J.K Rowling divulges into when she writes; the movies totally exclude all her wondrous details, and especially the details that are needed in order to figure out who is who, and how Harry Potter is going to solve the dilemma. \\n I absolutely love the beginning, and how Dumbledore begins to show Harry all that he needs to know in order to conquer and kill Voldemort. I just feel as if Harry should\\'ve paid more attention to each word Dumbledore said, and should\\'ve asked more questions before he couldn\\'t anymore. He\\'s left with a lot of unanswered questions that I feel Dumbledore could\\'ve known. \\n I loved the fact that Rowling tied in Draco\\'s initiation as a Death Eater, quite perfectly into the book. I just knew Harry\\'s concerns about Draco were quite right, and I wish he could\\'ve gotten into the Room of Requirement, before they brought in the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. \\n I also love the Weasley twins and how helpful their inventive jokes were to Harry, as well as Hermione and Ron. \\n What I didn\\'t like from the book was the fact that it took Ron and Hermione a WHOLE book, and several significant others, in order for them to find out that they liked each other, and the feelings were reciprocated. Even though Harry knew that they liked each other all along. The relationship between Ginny and Harry also took quite some time, but I guess that\\'s all relationships with teenagers. \\n Harry made it another whole year. As readers though, we hope he can say the same next year... but it all comes down to the prophecy... one must die, and one must live., The last Harry Potter book I read was The Half-Blood Prince. I\\'d already seen the movie, so I skipped this one and tried reading Deathly Hallows. I couldn\\'t remember a whole lot of the movie aside from the final few scenes. Re-reading it was an interesting experience but I can see why it wasn\\'t really that interesting. \\n After reading Order of the Phoenix, I noticed how long the books dragged on. The plot has a lot of filler and often dodges the main storyline or tends to dedicate entire chapters to seemingly minor details down to Harry\\'s new annoying house elf, an examination at the new minister of muggles, Ginny\\'s new love interest and the Half-Blood Prince himself, who has a seemingly minor role in this book. Even though the book is named after him, it didn\\'t seem to be the main focus at all here. \\n The story focuses on a few main things: Professor Slughorn\\'s long-forgotten memory of Voldemort, Malfoy\\'s secretive shenanigans and the identity of the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. Like I said, the Half-Blood Prince himself feels rather unimportant, in particular to the other two dilemmas. The first one, Professor Slughorn\\'s memory, involves Harry making several feeble attempts to appeal to him. The latter dilemma doesn\\'t seem very out of the ordinary. Throughout the entire series, Malfoy has always been a rather suspicious character and casting him for a villain was bound to happen sooner or later. However, seeing Malfoy as an actual villain makes me uncomfortable, especially in comparison to Voldemort. Malfoy comes across as the obnoxious school bully - who\\'s had minimal character development past six books - rather than the big bad evil being to be feared. At most, he\\'s just an annoying sidekick who should get kicked around. \\n I suppose that overall, these main questions were my main gripe with the book. It seemed that the entire book was built up for the twist ending and that there were only two important points in the book: Voldemort\\'s secret and the dramatic ending. While building up to it is inevitable, it seems that over 600 pages worth of build-up is largely uneeded. \\n On a side note, Snape\\'s character was one of the more interesting endeavors of the book. We tend to get vague clues as to whether or not he is good or evil. This book explores that idea a lot more, though it tends to gravitate towards evil much more. Of course, this has already been going on through the last couple books anyways, so there\\'s nothing terribly new. \\n Though many will disagree with me, Harry comes off as a Mary Sue, or in this case, a Gary Stu. He inherits all of Sirius\\' old possessions (and gracefully doesn\\'t want one of the buildings he\\'d owned), is credited for saving half of Ron\\'s family and gets attention from plenty of girls trying to get into the Slug Club. He also happens to be Dumbledore\\'s favorite student and the most adept person in his Potions class. \\n On a side note, somebody did reveal how the naming of the characters in the first book seemed to come off as a cheap trick. For example, Malfoy\\'s mom is named Narcissa, which sounds a lot like Narcissus. Fenrir Greyback is a werewolf, and his name is an allusion to a wolf god in Norse mythology. Another wolf, Lupin, has his name sound strikingly similar to Lupus, one of the scientific names for dogs. To me, it does seem a bit cheap. I mean, it\\'s cool to allude to mythology, but in real terms, how many Fenrirs were destined to grow up to be werewolves? To put it in better terms, it reminds me of Cruella DeVille from 101 Dalmatians, whose name is clearly meant to resemble cruel devil on account of how evil she is. \\n Anyways, much like Order of the Phoenix, this book tends to drag on a bit more than it really should, but the last few ending chapters are rewarding and help set the dramatic stage for the final book, Deathly Hallows. It gives some interesting insight into Voldemort\\'s history and features one of the most dramatic moments in all of Harry Potter history., My favorite. Sweet Glory., I really enjoyed this instalment in Harry\\'s adventures. The characters have developed beautifully over the series. They\\'re capable of surprising me, yet acting according to their natures., The ending really had me reeling., In spite of everythingb, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a yr=ear or ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with ron and hermione., loved it more on my second time around, Probably my favorite book of all seven Harry Potter books. Those book is funny, beautiful, frightening and tragic plus every other emotion you can imagine! It broke my heart the first time I read it and it didn\\'t cease to do it for this the 100th (or so it feels like) time too. I love these books; I love the characters; I love Harry Potter! \\n If for some reason you haven\\'t read these books I would suggest you do so at this very moment. If you don\\'t have time for reading listen to the audiobook. Jim Dale will not disappoint you., Why J.K? Why?! DX I live for your endings, but this is too much for my heart, I can\\'t handle it xc, I\\'m... I\\'m not crying. I\\'m not laying on the edge of my bed, completely immobilized and struggling to breathe. Really. I\\'m not. \\n But I have to say that this book is probably my favourite of all the books in this series, even despite the inevitable death of one my most favourite and cherished characters. The last half was so intense that I couldn\\'t stop plowing through it till the end. It was both an emotional ride and, somehow, immensely powerful. \\n Now, excuse me while I stare at the ceiling for the next couple of hours in complete despair., Lexile 1030L \\n IL: MG+ - BL: 7.2 - AR Pts: 29.0, This was boring though it did have the most humour of all the books it didn\\'t have me reading to know what happened next. SPOILER Snape kills Dumbledore, ( but that was so Malfoy didn\\'t have to)!, This is about the sixth year of Harry Potter\\'s education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Voldemort is trying to kill Harry as always., Wow., I think I love this book more than the previous ones. \\n I never got bored and I couldn\\'t stop reading it. Every moment, every detail was so interesting. \\n SPOILER ALERT: \\n I feel very very very sorry for Draco, and I definitely feel incomplete without Dumbledore. His death was so sad. And I enjoy a loooooooot Voldemort\\'s past-I wish I could learn more about him and his experiences in Hogwarts-. \\n Finally, this book was FANTASTIC., The end was so sad:c, Pretty good. The story and characters are much better in this one. The tone is darker and the story is mostly to the point. Probably my favorite so far out of all of these, though #3 was pretty good too., J.K. Rowling is the best .I cried while I was reading the last chapter, and I don\\'t usually cry because books but this one is different. I mean every character was just perfect...everything . can\\'t wait to read the last book, My favorite in the series so far. Took me about a week to read and I loved every piece of it. So excited to get on to book 7 but i\\'m not sure I want the story to end., One of the great books in a great series - funny, filled with adventure, with a shocking ending. Escapist literature doesn\\'t get better than this., Omg I could not put this down!! \\n FREAKING SNAPE OMG AND DUMBLEDORE AND THE FEELS AND UGHHH \\n Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermoine are the real ships to sail that\\'s all I\\'m saying \\n Harry still annoyed the hell out of me though. \\n I loved it and I want the next one immediately but I\\'m prepared for tears. Sorry if this review is a mess., sigh, AWESOME!!!, I haven\\'t read this in such a long time. I love all the things we learn about Voldemort. Hate Snape still. Dumbledore...that gets me every time. I love Harry\\'s character in here. Can\\'t wait to finally reread Deathly Hallows., lSdmh h~ `nwn hdh ljz \\n khyran Zhr snb `l~ Hqyqth \" lwskhh \" \\n lkn lymkn tklmh lrwyh bdwn dmbldwr :/ \\n l `rf mdh f`lt f~W hdhh lslslh :), favorite book so far...was absolutely left in shock when i finished, \"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" \\n I almost cried at the end, so many emotions.... Darkness has returned and will become darker in the next (and last) book., My heart is dead forever, No hay manera en la que pueda pensar en darle menos puntuacion a estos libros. Todos merecen 5/5. Admiro mucho la imaginacion y el mundo que la autora creo. Tienen un desarrollo perfecto. \\n Lo mas que disfrute de este es la explicacion y el trasfondo que te da de Voldemort, te hace sentir que lo conoces de toda la vida. \\n No quisiera empezar las reliquias de la muerte por que no estoy listo para terminar esta saga., The entire wizarding world knows of Voldemort\\'s return. As Harry Potter returns for his sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he knows that things will be different this year. Dumbledore has special plans that require Harry\\'s secrecy as together they plumb the depths of Voldemort\\'s past in the hopes of finding a way to defeat him. \\n This book has less angsting than the previous book did. It is easy to get drawn into the tale of Voldemort\\'s past and aside from Harry stalking Draco for half the book, this was pretty enjoyable. I haven\\'t read this for a while now and all I really remember of the movie is that they took out a lot of what made this book interesting. \\n I enjoyed it more than I thought I would and even knowing the ending I still had a blast rereading it. \\n The penultimate book of a well-crafted series. \\n ***Reading Challenge 2016: A book with a first name in the title***, It gets me every time I read it... So good!, Resena en el blog: http://bookeaterthings.tumblr.com/pos..., This is the best one of the series by far, love re-reading these books, Haven\\'t sobbed like that in a while so thank you J. K! Honestly I\\'m so annoyed at my younger self that i didn\\'t read this series when it was all popular and big, reading later when the fandom isn\\'t so crazy (but are still so devoted!) makes me want to hit myself. I WANT MORE. Give me the conclusion!, First, imagine someone driving a dull, rusted dagger through your chest. Your skin is all torn up, possibly irreparably damaged and deformed, and the pain is unlike anything you\\'ve ever felt before. Now imagine someone whom you love dearly taking that dagger and twisting it slowly and then ripping it out of your chest before doing the same with your heart. Imagine them crushing it before your very eyes. Imagine the hurt, the betrayal and the heartache you\\'d feel. \\n That\\'s how I feel right now. I\\'m completely torn apart and heartbroken. Who knew a book could affect my emotions so drastically. (Well, I did, but that\\'s besides the point.) Dumbledore\\'s death , though I\\'d expected it because of spoilers I stumbled across online, still came as a shock to me. Harry has witnessed so much loss and grief, firsthand... And to think Snape was the one who did it! After all those semi-spoilers I saw of him turning out to be a hero or whatever, learning that he had done it was crippling. \\n I suspect I\\'ll only feel more heartache as I continue with Deathly Hallows. I\\'m ready for the pain:)))), When I sat and thought about it, I realized there wasn\\'t really a whole lot of things that actually happened in this book. There are a few hugely important events, but all in all, the majority of the story is background information and series of suspicions and small occurrences that lead to the important events. That being said, I actually really liked this book. It felt like things were happening all the time even though it was only thoughts or history being presented. \\n The story opens with Dumbledore escorting Harry to the Weasleys\\' house. They take a detour on the way and end up visiting Professor Slughorn, a man Dumbledore is attempting to get to teach at Hogwarts that year. Through Harry\\'s efforts, Professor Slughorn agrees to come to the school. Harry is rather baffled why Dumbledore seems to express such importance on Slughorn going to Hogwarts, but this is later discovered by Harry. At the Weasleys\\' you learn of Bill and Fleur\\'s engagement and upcoming wedding and the gang prepares for another year at school. When they visit Diagon Alley for supplies, they are saddened by the number of closed shops and the scared feeling from the crowd because of Voldemort\\'s return and current mayhem. They also visit Weasleys\\' Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop run by Fred and George. When they return to school, Harry begins to take lessons with Dumbledore on the history of Voldemort in order to better understand his enemy. They start back at the very beginning with Voldemort\\'s parents and later with him in the orphanage before he comes to Hogwarts. Later, Harry discovers that Slughorn was plays a key role in an important aspect of Voldemort\\'s rise of power - a memory that Harry has to persuade off the new potions teacher. The leads to the discovery and belief that Voldemort created Horcruxes, objects that hold a piece of his soul that allows him to remain alive even if his body is dead. Throughout this whole time, Harry is also balancing his lessons with being the Quidditch captain, a budding relationship with Ginny, and chasing Draco Malfoy around. Harry believes Malfoy to be a Deatheater and up to something at the school. He employs Dobby and another house elf to follow Draco and figure out what he is up to. Harry believes he is behind the two near death experiences of two students, but cannot prove it. All he knows is that Draco disappears into the Room of Requirement for long periods of time. What he is truly doing is discovered at the end of the book, proving Harry right. Furthermore, Harry is accidentally given a book in potions class that has been written in and modified by someone who identifies themselves as the Half-Blood Prince. Throughout the book, Harry uses this modified potions book to excel in his potions class and get close to Slughorn. The modified book as provides new spells written in the margins that have varying effects. Hermione is convinced the book is written by a dark wizard, but Harry insists on continuing to read it and learn the new jinxes. The end result of this study is a brutal surprise that leaves Harry reeling from what he has done. \\n The book covers a lot of information.The majority of the time, Harry is in high emotional states, usually angry or frustrated that no one will believe him about Malfoy. There is a lot of stress from being the Quidditch captain and his growing relationship with Ginny is interesting to see. There is a funny sort of way the author describes Harry\\'s coming to realize his feelings for Ginny that I found rather amusing. The growing relationship between Hermione and Ron is also fraught with emotional turmoil as Ron dates Lavender. The struggle between the boys and Hermione about the Half-Blood Prince\\'s book gets somewhat old, but at least the boys come up with different reasons why Harry should keep reading it each time the subject is brought up. Most interesting was probably the history on Voldemort. You learn a lot about him that you didn\\'t know before and can see how everyone noticed something was wrong but didn\\'t stop him before he left Hogwarts. Also, the Horcruxes were an interesting item that helps explain a lot about Voldemort and provides for a more complex story line in the future. \\n Overall, I think the book was great and showed a fairly good depth of character that was missing in the earliest books. You get to see more emotion from all the characters and the result is just a deeper feeling book that pulls you in. The book didn\\'t feel like it dragged along in places, but kept the pace going continually through the book. Again, this is not the best book for young children, but probably middle school age or higher is my suggestion. \\n https://bookmouseblog.wordpress.com/2..., The pain! dY~ it just gets worse with every book, Not my favorite book of the series... but still a great read. The cliff hanger of this book, while evil, will capture the attention of a lazy reader and inspire them to read more., one of the better books in the series, glad we got more about Snape., This book has never really been my favourite, but it\\'s SO IMPORTANT to the series., I read this before I had a goodreads account. \\n Many say they cried when they read this one. I did not. I was numbed by how it ended and merely passed the book onto my son who was similarly . . . \\n Well, not really surprised. Truth is, I knew the ending was coming. I just didn\\'t know when. I actually had expected the ending in book 5 but that is one of the things I like about these books. When I first read them, even if I thought I knew what would happen, I was always surprised by what actually ended up happening. Rowling was able to fulfill my expectations by not meeting them in a way that I could easily anticipate. Wonderful! \\n Edit 2012 \\n I recently reread this book and posted a review here: \\n http://satiasreviews.blogspot.com/201... \\n It held up even upon rereading, making me tear up just as it had done before. That says it all!, Jojo, Potter je Potter :), \"And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\" \\n **Spoilers Alert . \\n This is the only Harry Potter Book that I didn\\'t review yet, the sole reason is that the end was marvelous, amazing , that I just didn\\'t wait to write the review and started the deathly hallows instantly . however I loved The Deathly Hallows and didn\\'t wait to write this book\\'s review to express my whole ocean of feelings about it . So, somehow the review was never written , but no damage done because one of the Harry Potter perks is that not even a tiny detail is ever Forgettable . \\n The story starts as always with the Dursleys . this time Dumbledore has a trip for Harry before he settles in the burrow and then back to Hogwarts . as the events progresses Harry is lent a potions book by Professor Slughorn, an old friend of Dumbledore\\'s who they convince to step by their side and eventually teach potions in Hogwarts . in the book Harry finds a number of notes from it\\'s previous owner, which allows Harry to excel in a subject he has never been more than average at. The book is marked \"Property of the Half-Blood Prince\". Who\\'s this half blood prince , the potions brilliant ? Hermione is slightly suspicious but they have too many other things in mind to bother much about it . Harry is a little affronted by Dumbledore\\'s disinterest in his doubts and fears . anyways soon we\\'d be introduced to what\\'s called Horcruxes and dive in their mysteries . \\n I love this book , its fast paced , nothing seems safe anymore , everything is at risk even Hogwarts that has always been the safe haven . its quite dark at places . the flashbacks that tell us about Voldemort\\'s / Tom Riddle\\'s past is so absorbing . I always like to read the stories of the villains , I like to know what led them to be whatever they are . \\n Also in this book we can notice that Rowling seems to be trying for more complicated prose and more sophisticated storytelling than each of her previous books . There are plenty of questions left unanswered by the end and We also learn a lot more about the characters, We even see whole other sides of them , maybe change our model thinking about them . Draco Malfoy is one of these . \\n The final plot twist , which is Dumbledore\\'s killer identity is absolutely unforeseen even shocking {if it\\'s not spoiled for you , off course } and Dumbledore\\'s death overall is devastating , the one who was always been there to solve problems , the background Hero , their savior , the strongest wizards in the world\\'s Death puts everything at stake . \\n His death is one of the most emotional . The only two deaths that made me cry were Dumbledore\\'s and Dobby\\'s . Though I have to admit that if I had the choice to bring one character to life that most definitely would be Fred , but when I say emotional I mean that we had time to cry , to mourn our loss . Fred \\'s , Sirius\\'s , Lupin\\'s , Tonks\\'s . All these deaths happened in the middle of a battle , in the middle of a sentence we had no time to feel them fully at the time .But Later they\\'d hurt when Re-reading the books or when thinking about the whole image but while reading You\\'d feel Dumbledore\\'s and Dobby\\'s the most . At least that\\'s what happened with me . \\n Yes ! off course Dobby is still alive here , also all the other characters above but I am generally speaking . \\n All in all , its a Harry Potter Book , That\\'s an enough compliment , I loved it as much as I loved all the other books maybe slightly more than few others . \\n *Peace upon your hearts You who are going to read the deathly Hallows . Get yourselves ready , you\\'d need self control and tissues , Yes paper tissues you\\'d need that * \\n READ IT HERE, This was actually my favorite book in the series. Most considered it boring, but it\\'s been one I have read over and over again with zeal., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Chorando a 4 capitulos. J.K. mais uma vez arrancando e despedacando meu coracao. Preciso ler algo feliz e bobo ja!, Wow. Rowling really beefed up the YA category with this one. I\\'ve rarely seen a supposed children\\'s author delve so deeply into darker material as Rowling in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and it is a rewarding experience. \\n Also, as a note: The Harry Potter movies are inestimably less impactful than the books. I\\'m watching the movies first, and then reading the books, and I\\'ve found in each case that not only did the book make more sense, it was also more powerful and interesting as well., Recensione su: http://wp.me/p3X6aw-4x \\n Review on: http://wp.me/p3X6aw-4x, Wowowowow it\\'s so hard to not hate Snape. So frustrating. Gahhh., I haven\\'t sobbed this hard in ages, ** spoiler alert ** \\n **This review is for personal purposes only** \\n I loved this book way more the second-time around. I had forgotten a lot of what happened (probably due to the influence of the movie version). I loved seeing Harry\\'s relationship with Dumbledore grow and getting to find out about Voldemort\\'s past. I liked seeing Malfoy change from only being Harry\\'s nemesis at school to a troubled boy struggling with the path his parent\\'s put him on. Slughorn was a great addition to the novels\\' character list. I\\'m still not a big fan of Snape in this book. It is interesting to see him kill of Dumbledore, which leads up to the \"redeeming\" revelations about him in the 7th book. However, to me he will always be a man who bullys children and this is not exception in the 6th book. I wish is Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were highlighted more because those lessons could have been interesting. \\n I don\\'t love Ginny and Harry together, but I can deal with it. I just don\\'t like the whole \"I never really gave up on you\" part from Ginny - I actually preferred her with the other guys because it made her feel like a real person instead of a tag-along to Harry. I feel like she gets eclipsed every time she is put with him romantically. \\n I am confused though with how old Hermione is. Her birthday is in September and she was allowed to take the Apparition test, which must mean she turned seventeen months before the test. However, only Ron\\'s 17th birthday is ever mentioned in the text. I wish her coming-of-age would have been celebrated more too., http://nuagesdelivres.blogspot.fr/201..., My personal favorite Harry Potter book! I just love getting to know All the backstory. These books will never ever get old. Could reread these forever., To my mind, this episode in the HP saga shows Harry at his most complex. The romance with Ginny that everyone hoped was coming finally gets a kick in the pants, he is given a new leadership role (Quidditch captain) while also engaging in dubious behavior. He experiences moments of empathy toward Voldemort and Draco Malfoy while clinging tightly to his distaste for Severus Snape. And in the final pages he is launched on his final quest to take place in the seventh book. \\n Best bits (back to Dumbledore): \\n \"Ah... how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute.\" (Dumbledore, 359) \\n \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\" (Dumbledore, 510) \\n \"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" (Dumbledore, 566), Ugh...all the feels. Dumbledore feels. Hinny feels. Draco feels. No one ever listening to hHarryarry feels. I just .. I have a lot of feelings., Maldito Snape... Dumbledore :(, Wow, ahhh... all those old feels...., I\\'m a mess right now :\\'( :\\'(, speechless! im absolutely speechless, ** spoiler alert ** \\n The sixth installment in the Potter series is a departure; it\\'s completely character driven with little plot on it\\'s own, more of a set-up for what\\'s to come than an actual story itself. Parts of it, for the first time in the series, have the feeling of info dump about them, which could probably have been weaved into the series better, but those same parts are not guilty of dragging for all the information given. \\n The characters here are better than ever. Dumbledore, Harry\\'s mentor, weakens and becomes more human, and there are more glimpses behind Draco Malfoy\\'s behavior. Some readers are put off by the character driven stuff: the romances, the backstory, etc. but I loved it. Great development of the characters who really haunted my imagination well after I finished the book., so sad, dumbledore death has come, Wow, it\\'s been a while since I read this the first time. We learn so much more about Voldemort. I am still clinging tenaciously to my trust of Snape, though it is difficult. I am hoping that Dumbledore was right. Anyway, this is probably my 2nd favorite of the series so far., This story follows Harry\\'s exploits as he spirals closer and closer to what seems to be a murky and dark future. The writing is, as ever, superb and witty as you\\'re drawn into the darkness and depth of Harry\\'s world. Angrier and moodier, Harry\\'s suspicions grow ever wilder as he tries to piece together the actions and behaviors of his school \\'enemies\\' and the frustration that comes with not being listened to or taken seriously. This book really brings to light Harry\\'s compassion and lets us see how he realizes that all is not always what it seems. \\n Brillant plotting, fun and scary all at once. J K Rowling is a genius. \\n Read Jan 2010 - Feb 2010 \\n Read Jan 2011 - Feb 4/11 \\n Read Jan 2012 - Feb 4/12 \\n Read Jan 11/13 - Jan 29/13 \\n Read Feb 28/14 \\n Read Jan 4/16 - Jan 25/16, I\\'d say smthg but I don\\'t want to spoil it for shqiponja, \"Killing is not so easy as the innocent believe.\" \\n I am dead. I can\\'t. . . \\n It hurts just as much the second time *cries hysterically* \\n Raise Your Wands for the Greatest wizard known to wizardkind. \\n I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \\n . \\n My Review of Harry Potter and Order of the Phoenix \\n . \\n . \\n . \\n 1st read in August 2014 \\n /5 (9.0/10) \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is an eye-opener. J.K. Rowling lets the reader dive into Voldemort\\'s past. Harry understands why Voldemort is who he is and what Voldemort\\'s principles are. This information is very satisfactory for the reader because by knowing the mystery that is Lord Voldemort, the mystery gets unraveled. \\n Harry shows bravery as he has never shown before. At the end of the book he chooses to walk into the arena with his head held high, instead of being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death. Harry is not afraid of death. Harry wants Voldemort finished and he wants to be the one who does it. Because one of them must die, one of them is going to end up killing the other. It is the way it is supposed to be. Harry\\'s bravery is the key point of the novel, without it the novel wouldn\\'t be as exhilarating and exciting. He is a true Gryffindor. \\n The novel has a lot of important and surprising turning points. Finding out that even Dumbledore can make a misjudgment in character is very painful for the whole wizarding world, especially Dumbledore himself. For the mistake resulted in his demise. It comes as a great shock to see him die. The reader might think it was a hoax or a trick, however, when it is eventually realised that it is an ugly truth, all one can do is read on and hope for brighter days. \\n I am very sad to see Dumbledore go. Harry now has no mentors to guide him anymore. His parents, his godfather, his headmaster they are all dead. The only people he has left are his friends, Dumbledore\\'s Army and the Order of the Phoenix. Godspeed, Harry. \\n Harry\\'s loyalty to Dumbledore is awe-inspiring and simply wonderful. Even after he has been murdered, Harry is loyal to him. Because he knows that Dumbledore will never be truly gone if there are still people who remain loyal to him. This relationship is one which will never be broken, the Dark Lord cannot break the true and faithful hearts of Dumbledore\\'s Army. The relationships between the characters make the novel so worthwhile. They are realistic; there might be disputes but a strong friendship can overcome anything. \\n \\'\\'Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,\\'\\' - Hermione, p.95 \\'\\'Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies.\\'\\' - Tom Riddle or as he would love to be called Lord Voldemort, p.415 \\n \"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort\\'s! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart,\" - Dumbledore, p.477-478 \\n \\'\\'age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth\\'\\' - Dumbledore, p.528, I cannot believe this, It was so so so good and exciting \\n I can\\'t believe the end of that..., This one held a lot of plot devices for the last book, but I ripped through it right away. It\\'s a Harry Potter world - I\\'m just visiting., Short ramblings to come., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I totally enjoyed this book because this was the first book in the set that I read that has not come out as a movie yet. I couldn\\'t believe how fast I had moved along through it... all of a sudden I was halfway done! \\n I enjoyed learning more about Tom Riddle and Dumbledore\\'s plans. I can\\'t believe Dumbledore died though! AAAAAAAAAAA! I kept waiting for him to come back at the end of the movie that maybe Snape had said the words \"Avada Kedavra\" outloud but in his mind it was really more like a stun spell. I was really sad... almost didn\\'t want to read the 7th book! \\n Another thing, throughout the book I kept thinking that Voldemort would be the half-blood prince. I never thought it would be Snape. I mean... what? A whole book about Snape? Not really., My distinct memory from this book is flinging is across the room, sobbing, when Dumbledore died, and it hitting the opposite corner of my room with an actual THUD and then my mom coming in and saying maybe I shouldn\\'t be reading books that make me so emotional. TOO LATE XD, I\\'m a crying mess in this moment , I knew it was coming but it hurt SO BAD! And also the way that Ron and Hermione stand by Harry at the end it\\'s just amazing #BffGoals, The 6th instalment in the Harry Potter series, and it just gets better and better. I have to say it again - I was not a great fan of HP when they first came out, because I just simply was not into children\\'s book. But what a wonderful story teller JK Rowling is. The plot now thickens, and everything comes together, or gets unravelled even further. The Dark Lord is back - that much is confirmed, and all hell seems to break loose, though some still deny it initially. And yes, a major character dies in this book which I shall not reveal here, for all those who have not yet read the book nor watched the movie. I had seen the movie, but honestly, reading the book is just a completely different experience. \\n JK Rowling is simply a master in weaving her plot (and this over several books), and all the characters are unique. We are talking about a fantasy world, but they still face the same problems like us (or like us Muggles shall I say) and thus are completely believable. It is a skill to create characters which appeal both to a child/teenage audience and also to adults. Also, all the magical creates are so well drawn out - even if you have not seen the movies, it is easy to form a picture in your imagination, and this is what reading is all about. \\n By the way, Stephen King has the Harry Potter Books in his recommended list of books to read if you want to be a writer. \\n http://thepegsterreads.blogspot.co.uk..., This book is my favorite out of the whole series. I have read it over a million times. Though i wish there could have been a little bit more of Harry and Ginny (hinny). The\\'re my favorite couple. But other than that i loved it!, Update: favorite book of the series easily, and the movie\\'s great too. Everything about this book is fantastic (besides *spoiler*\\'s death) \\n Nononononononononononononononono \\n Leave me alone while I cry in a corner for 5 hours., I love this book possibly the most of the series and was so thrilled to read it to my kids but I\\'d forgotten how many loose ends the book leaves! My kids were dying to start the 7th book the moment we finished this one because they insisted they\\'d die from the suspense. Also, high five to them for figuring out who the half blood prince was at the beginning of the book! I love reading this series out loud with my kids!, Now, I don\\'t know how to continue my life. how to continue living?, HOW could i go so long without Reading Harry Potter??? I want to slap my younger self for believing it wasn\\'t \"that good\". \\n Anyway this is my favorite Harry Potter book alongside with the Goblet of Fire. \\n Every little page was perfect and I\\'m not exaggerating., I remembered a lot less of this one that I had expected. Not my favorite of the books, it seems more transitional and functionaly and inspired and fun filled. I still try to watch for indications that Snape is \"good\" or \"bad\" throughout this tale in particular and still can\\'t figure it out. Still enjoying the narrator and listening with Paige., Drink it!, I need a moment... Maybe a day, but knowing me I won\\'t give myself any and I\\'ll start reading the deathly Hallows any minute now, This one was my favorite of all seven! Some of the scenes have stuck in my head and that what i think of when i think of Harry Potter! Amazing book!, What a great read to end the year on! I\\'m bummed I didn\\'t get to book seven in time, however, there is always next Harry Christmas to You. \\n What intrigued me the most in this book is seeing how human Dumbledore was. Despite his flaws, it\\'s clear he loved Harry. I remember being so infuriated when I first read the ending. And, of course, it still hurts. I suppose I will end this short review with a few additional words. \"Nitwit! Oddment! Blubber! Tweak!\", Enjoyed this almost as much as the first time I read it all those years ago. Always worth reading, one of my favourite Harry Potter books (of the original 7, that is.), 4.6 estrellas, este libro es, !ah, magnifico! Los secretos revelados, los cambios de personaje, las misiones a las que se enfrentan, la relacion de Dumbledore y Harry, el romance que existe y como te vas dando cuenta de ciertas cosas que antes parecian pasar desapercibidas, me encanto. \\n No tengo idea de porque pero no puedo odiar a Voldemort, incluso algunos de los mortifagos me llegan a dar lastima. Sin embargo, Snape es algo completamente diferente. \\n Definitivamente la saga mejora conforme avanza la saga, y no puedo esperar a llegar al septimo. \\n 6/7, Even though I read this book three times, I still bawled when I read Dumbledore\\'s death. It just rips my heart out! Even though I know what is going to happen, I couldn\\'t put the book down. There are just so many details that I forgot about. Such a good series!, This and Azkaban are my favorites. J.K. Rowling is a goddess., The story plot was very interesting. I actually really liked it. I stopped reading though, because the book was making me frustrated and annoyed. Harry and his friend\\'s attitudes about the things they went through and the inconclusive resolve of the issues they faced just grated on me. I\\'m generally affected by the feelings of others and even the feelings of fictional characters. I wanted to finish the series, but when it was making me so frustrated and upset, it didn\\'t seem wise to continue. \\n Having finished most of the books, I will say that the things I most disliked about the book were the \"promotion\" of disobedience. Harry really didn\\'t get punished...almost ever, for doing almost every single thing that should have gotten him expelled from the school. Well, I guess he did get detention, but the book always seemed to portray such occurrences as unwarranted and unfair. I understand that Harry might have seen it that way, but that doesn\\'t mean that the whole attitude of the book should reflect Harry\\'s immature focus. The other things I didn\\'t like were the absence of Ginny and the wallowing in depressing feelings. The first I disliked because, well, who doesn\\'t want to see more about the main character and the person they eventually marry? Plus, the whole not-including-Ginny, to me at least, gave me the impression (which I hated having) that Harry simply liked Ginny because she really liked him and cared about him, not because he saw something in her. As to the wallowing in feelings, I simply didn\\'t like that because it affect me emotionally and frustrated me. \\n What I did like: The plot was great. It didn\\'t remind me of anything I\\'d already read. I like reading something that seemed so entirely \"new\", something I couldn\\'t exactly guess every new turn. It stayed interesting and never really seemed to drag on., Powerful., I love it!!, I like to books a lot more than the movies!, Re-read 21/8/16 in preparation for cursed child, I want to give this way more than five stars, \"Mischief Managed.\" \\n ...somebody else had spoken Snape\\'s name, quite softly. \"Severus...\" The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading. Snape said nothing, but walked forward and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. ... Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face. \\n \"Severus... Please...\" \\n Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore. \\n \"Avada Kedavra!\". \\n (HBP pg 595/556) \\n It certainly deserves more than 4 stars but,..well., This book and the Deathly Hallows was my favorite!, Wonderful, but what\\'s new?, Pithole the size of a 652 pages book in my heart. with the last words on the last page, my heart quivered , tears strolled down warmer and faster. Albus Dumbledore ..... \\n Sirius and now Dumbledore i can\\'t take it. \\n J K.R i don\\'t know what to feel , do I hate you or do i love you?? \\n i don\\'t want to write more and I\\'m not sure I\\'m ready for the next heart shattering part I\\'m sure it Will be. \\n just NEXT., Listened to the audiobook this time around and it was fantastic! Jim Dale was a wonderful choice for the entire series., GD, J.K. Rowling! First you kill Sirius Black, and if I just read that chapter correctly, Snape has just made a vow to kill freakin\\' Dumbledore? That the H?, Re-read June 2016, This is both the best and worst HP so far! I loved it and thought it was by far the best.....and then. Well you know what happened. I now think it is the worst (but still kind of the best. Gah!). Im so sad :(, If I\\'m not mistaken, this is my fav among Harry Potter series., Well, Harry Potter just keeps getting better and better, I guess. \\n And I\\'m dead. Why do writers do this to us?!, That ending though..., I\\'m years overdue on rereading the Harry Potter books. Need to get in one last round before college!, Just finished the audio book. Was very good. Though I don\\'t like the way Jim Dale does Ginny\\'s voice. \\n But other than that, a fantastic audio book. \\n On to Deathly Hallows!, Mysterious, suspenseful, heart-wrenching? There is no single word that can describe this book when so much is going on in this one. I felt like the rope in a tug-of-war, my emotions being pulled back and forth, leaving me to wonder which feeling would win out in the end. \\n Is it wrong to view the characters as much a part of my life as real people? Shaking my head at the stubbornness between Ron and Hermione, I restrained myself from scolding the two of them down on the page, \"Why can\\'t you admit your feelings for each other?!\" And, despite my years of hating Draco, I couldn\\'t help feeling a little sympathy for him as he struggled to complete the Dark Lord\\'s bidding - Draco is just a boy, after all. \\n Despite the moments of aggravation and sighs of sadness, nothing compares to the hole in my chest that was left at the very end of the book. No! I cannot tell you what it is. But, have tissues handy near the last chapters. If you don\\'t cry tears of sadness, you will of rage - red red rage! \\n Though I do love the Harry Potter books, I have to complain about the way people die in Rowling\\'s books (sorry about the hint). It\\'s always so quick that it almost feels painless... almost. The sadness washes over me with a slow realization of who has been lost, but the initial death scenes always have me wondering, \"What? What just happened? Did that person just die?\" It\\'s just so abrupt. The first realization is lost on me and squeezes zero emotion out of me. My tears can\\'t spill until the next chapter when I see the characters\\' reaction. \\n There is such a thing as being too final. Luckily, this is not the final book. Though many of us already know what happens, the rest of you can just imagine what is in store with the last book. Prepare for battle, everyone! \\n - EZRead Staffer, Amelia, I HEART IT!, This is an epic read. I love whole series but this one is epic., I\\'m crying HARD., Book 6 suffers from being wedged between the exceptional Book 5 (My favorite) and the finale of the series. It doesn\\'t hold up to those two. \\n And that\\'s not to say there isn\\'t anything strong about it. The introduction of Horace Slughorn serves an important and intriguing purpose. He\\'s recruited out of retirement to teach Potions, moving Snape over to Defense Against the Dark Arts. \\n Dumbledore give Harry lots of history lessons about Tom Riddle in his pre-Voldemort days. We learn about the dark magic of horcruxes. And Draco Malfoy is up to no good. \\n But the first two-thirds of the book is slow-moving. It\\'s those history lessons and a lot of snogging. A LOT of snogging. Ron becomes a Quidditch stud and snogs with Lavender. Harry and Ginny start snogging. Lots and lots of snogging. Why are they snogging so much when even the Ministry is acknowledging that Voldy is back? \\n The final third is gripping when Dumbledore and Harry go to a dark cave to find a horcrux. I won\\'t spoil the big shocker of an ending, but it\\'s a necessary loss for Harry the hero moving forward while giving another character a shot at redemption. \\n If not for the final part of this book, I\\'d probably give it 3 to 3.5 stars. In my eyes, it\\'s probably the weakest in the series, but it\\'s a necessary entry to get to the end., I love all of the Harry Potter books and am so sorry that there are not more to read., Much better. Things really took off in the end, and I liked the added romance in this one. Ready for the last book!, This book predominantly acts as the set up for the final book. It\\'s still great though., All I can say is I love this book, I am looking forward to rereading this book., WORST ENDING EVER, Currently laughing at myself because I was dumb enough to think it wouldn\\'t hurt as much the second time around, So much better than HP 5! Which I disliked the book of and the movie based upon it., Even better than the first time around, but I am heartsick all over at the ending. Why oh why did he have to die? sigh., The ending always kills me. I had forgotten who the potions book belonged to, and part of the horcrux story. I added a star with this re-read., I would have given this one four stars but Harry is just getting so annoying that I had to cut one out. \\n Don\\'t get me wrong, I love the HP books with all my heart and soul, but I\\'ve always found Harry annoying (I\\'m one of the ones who read the books for the other characters, aka Fred and George:)) but this book he was just such a contemptible git! \\n So full of himself, so sorry for himself (I\\'ve been tired for the past four books of how he thinks he\\'s the only one who has lost parents.) so distrusting of people and disbelieving. \\n He is, quiet frankly, kind of an ass and not someone I would be friends with. \\n I also found the whole relationship thing with Ron and Lavender and Hermione very poorly done and kind of weird. \\n And Harry and Ginny was weirdly done. \\n Also, Dumbledore\\'s death felt really out of place and unrealistic....just saying, it felt kind of quick and, well, dumb., As usual, mindbogglingly fantastic, This book is nice, but not my favorite out of all series. But still nice., I feel like a horrible person for the 3 stars but i can not help it., Wow, this book was extremely well written. I could NOT put it down! I\\'m a HUGE Harry potter fan, and I mean huge as in I have posters of Harry potter covering the walls of my room. All of the mysteries and the excitement was a great touch and I think that everybody has to read the Harry potter series. EVERYBODY!, See Order of Phoenix, Well damn, it may be a toss up between this one and Goblet of Fire for my favorite thus far. Order of the Phoenix was a little bit tough to get through, but it was well worth it to read Half-Blood Prince. Shocking, well-written, and delivering all the usual amazing content, can\\'t wait to read the next., Pequena, aunque insuficiente mejoria. Por debajo de la media de la saga. Resena de la saga completa: \\n http://www.libros-prohibidos.com/jk-r..., I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH!!! I feel it is the deepest, most touching addition to the series so far. I cried, I laughed, I gasped, and thoroughly enjoyed it all the way. I can\\'t wait to read \"Deathly Hallows\", and I can\\'t believe I\\'ve never gotten to it before! Well, I\\'ll be sure to update once I get my hands on it. But, let me just say, I\\'m very, very pleased with the character development in \"Half-Blood Prince\" as well as the rest of the series. I can\\'t wait to see how much they grow and change more in \"Deathly Hallows\". Of course, the ending, or what was near to the ending, destroyed me, but hey, that\\'s life. Highly recommendable, five out of five stars. :), This book was twice as good as the first time I read it.....Which is impossible by the way. J.K. Rowling is a genus. (Like I never knew that), I am upset with myself for not reading the Harry Potter series when it came out more than 10 year ago. I started them, but only read the first three before I let myself get busy with life. I had not wanted to get too far ahead of the movies, but I have never even seen the first movie. \\n I am upset because I could have carried this story and the lessons it has in it for a decade longer than I now will. It is a wonderful, superbly written story. \\n I read the series with my oldest daughter. I just finished and she\\'s starting book seven. I can\\'t wait until she\\'s done so we can share our thoughts. It\\'s hard not to give much of anything away to her and I\\'ll try not to do that in this review as well. \\n When I originally read the first three books many years ago, there was a lot of controversy in the Christian world about whether children should read these books or not. I read it with an open mind and found them to resemble Roald Dahl\\'s stories where children who are ill treated by the adults in charge of them gain special powers and make a difference in the world. I thought they were well written and would do no harm to any child who knew it was a fiction story. \\n I took this approach with my daughter and talked to her about magic and fiction before she started reading. She has enjoyed the story and loves the characters, but understands that it is not real life. \\n This series has many great themes: love, good vs. evil, friendship, loyalty, keeping priorities straight, sacrifice, loss and grief. \\n In the first book (Sorcerer\\'s Stone), Harry learns why he can \"make things happen,\" who his parents are and what it feels like to have family and friends who love him. It establishes the series\\' foundation of love and friendship and how important they are in our lives. \\n The second book (Chamber of Secrets) starts to show Harry more of his path in fighting the enemy, Voldemort. He learns to start trusting his instincts and taking care of people. \\n The Prisoner of Azkaban introduces Harry to more family as he learns to not always trust those in power. He also finds the strength inside of him often comes from his parents\\' love. \\n In the fourth book (Goblet of Fire), Harry comes face to face with his enemy and learns how serious the fight of good vs. evil is - and that it can come with a price. \\n In the Order of the Phoenix, Harry helps the official group trying to fight off Lord Voldermot. He also faces persecution for standing up for what he knows is true. \\n Book six (Half-Blood Prince) takes Harry on the cusp of the fight of his life. Tragedy strikes close to home and he must decide to join the fight or get dragged into it. \\n The series ends (Deathly Hallows) with the final battle of good vs. evil. Harry realizes that he must sometimes rely on his friends and must sometimes face things by himself. His determination to protect those he loves leads to a great sacrifice. \\n I would recommend this series for older children and any adult. If your child is comfortable reading long chapter books and death, he or she would be ready to read the series. If you are an adult and have not read them yet, find a friend to read them with you or someone who has read them, because as soon as you read the final sentence, you will want someone to share your experience with., This book is magic. The first time I read the book in my teenage days , it was a story about the adventures of a boy named \\'Harry potter\\' . The entire story seemed to revolve around this person and was a fun filled ride. But , when I re-read it again recently , it was no more just the story about that \\'Potter\\' boy but mainly also about \\'Dumbeldore\\' , the man with the god-like aura , the protector whom Harry trusted his life with , the story of his wisdom and also of his weaknesses. It is the story of snape and why he is where he is. It is the story of the \\'Malfoys\\' where the reader might even sympathise with them. It is also the story of Tom Riddle a.k.a \\'Lord Voldemort\\' , his childhood , teenage and the reason he chose his name.Interestingly , one also learns that Tom Riddle and Severus Snape have quite a lot in common. \\n The biggest take away from this book is this , that death though looks mysterious and far , is the only thing real in life. The only thing in life without \\'Magic\\'., awesomeee ... my 2nd fav of harry potter *7th is the 1st* \\n i really enjoy this book. i\\'ve been read this aboutttt ... 9 times !!! cant get enuf .. >.< \\n harry really growing up here. he started to think more clearly than the 5th book .... \\n the main reason why i read this book again n again is harry is FANCIED ginny .. *@ last* ... \\n and its so sweet to see them 2gether ... \\n blah blah blah .. :D, Not since reading Steinbeck\\'s Of Mice and Men twenty-five years ago have I been smacked in the face as hard as this book hit me. I will not spoil anything, but this book ranks as my absolute favorite of the series so far and one of my all time favorites as well., \"It was, he thought, \\n the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. \\n Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, \\n but Dumbledore knew \\n - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - \\n that there was all the difference in the world\" \\n After reading this I need time to emotionally recuperate but at the same I need to read the last one. \\n This book just made me feel so many FEELS. It was beautifully sorrowful, yet exciting and I JUST LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT, Dumbledore dies, everybody cries, Im a Harry Potter fan and I waited waaaay too long to start reading the books. I knew what was coming in this book and yet I read it and loved it. I did cry like a baby though. Harry is getting all grown-up in this book and I like that he is taking his responsibilities and everything. Now Ill start reading Deathly Hallows and then Ill probably watch all the movies in like 2 days or so and yes, Ill love it., Excellent installment in a wonderful series., My chest feels as though my heart has been torn out from the book\\'s tragic ending as I sit here typing, hopelessly admiring the tactic Rowling used to achieve her greatest success to date in this much loved children\\'s book series. \\n J.K. Rowling truly has a gift for creating an entire world in our imaginations. \\n Rowling does not rely on expository; she does not subject readers to long passages of description and set-up in which no one but an omniscent narrator speaks. Instead, she uses the clever device of the Pensieve (a bowl-like receptacle for threads of people\\'s memories) to plunge both Harry and the reader directly into the memory/back-story. What we end up with is witty dialogue and character set-up to rival any of the scenes taking place at Hogwarts in the \"present.\" Rowling knows humans are more entertaining than character types, and her writing here reflects this. \\n This is the most emotional of the Harry Potter books to date because it ends, in the grand tradition of penultimate tales, at the nadir of the series. You want to say that things can only go up from the end of this one, but that ending makes it clear to readers, young and old alike, that there is no guarantee in that regard. Love might be the greatest power, but death is a stark reality. I subscribe to the idea that the target audience Rowling has been writing for is one that has been growing up along with the characters in the books, so reading this sixth novel will be hard for younger readers, while those of the same age as Harry, Ron and Hermione will be better able to deal with the more adult elements contained herein., Amazing book., So many tears., One of the three best in the series., Bra bok och manga nya tankar som fods kring slutet., I\\'m a bit ashamed that this took me 3 months to reread, but I think subconsciously I was avoiding what I knew was coming (The Phoenix Lament). The story is much m ore nuanced than I remember. It solidifies the bond between Harry and Dumbledore and gives more background on Voldemort, his youth, and his family. This book defines Harry\\'s loyalty to his mentor and his conviction to fulfill Dumbledore\\'s mission. But darn it if I didn\\'t hate how it had to end. \"...the last and greatest of his protectors had died, and he was more alone than he had ever been before.\", I have read a version of this that was somehow half the size, and I can say, the longer one was better. \\n The plot was fairly good, the characters were fairly annoying. \\n Altogether, there was way to much kissing. It was disgusting., Even though a lot happened in the last 50 pages of the book- I feel like this entire book was exposition for the last book. I knew what would happen at the end of this book- I have no idea what happens in book 7., Another magical year in the life of our beloved harry. Darker too, though. Lots of small details and nuances people love have been generously sprinkled.This year of his life is also a tragic reminiscence of his exclusivity. The death of dumbledore makes the book all the more endearing and unusual. The revelation about snape takes care of the darker side. Amazingly done. #rowlingfanforlife #harrypotterrocks, very good book the series is worth reading again, Another excellent re-read of a favourite., Fantastic read. Can\\'t believe the end., Although awesome as always, not my favorite of the series by far., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I feel like every scrap of information I can get about Voldemort just makes me that much more interested. Let\\'s be honest, I\\'m completely sucked in at this point. \\n I like that Dumbledore has some sort of level of honesty with Harry, FINALLY. After all it is Harry who will live or die accordingly with all the events. \\n Dumbledore being killed really wasn\\'t surprising, I feel it was necessary for Harry to fully come into his own. The fact that it was Snape was a delicious moment, although I know Snape isn\\'t evil I adore how he operates. He is the perfect spy. \\n Draco, I find myself feeling increasingly worried about him. \\n Overall just a beautiful book., My favorite of the series. This book makes me cry every time I read it. It is the most fun, the darkest, and the most depressing of the bunch. This book is when I finally realized that stories are not only fun, but can make me feel as well., Re-read october 2017: \\n HBP has always been my least favorite of the Harry Potter novels, maybe because of the added darkness and slowness... most of the novel is about Harry trying to figure out what Draco Malfoy is up to and not being able to let it go. Though, even if it\\'s my least favorite, it still contains the magic of the HP novels. Like the continuous hinting about Snape being the Half-Blood Prince , the friendships and the magic of Hogwarts. \\n And, one of the best sassy Harry moments of them all: There\\'s no need to call me \\'sir\\', Professor., And installment number 6 is just as good as the rest. Goes a little bit off topic for awhile with a lot of relationship issues...the pairing off of the characters gets more predominant. But have no fear, the main story continues in even more unexpected ways. Really was not seeing this ending coming. At all. Very surprising. It makes perfect sense now, thinking back on it...we always knew Harry had to face Voldemorte himself, so the moving aside of his trusted mentors is not shocking...just didn\\'t expect it to happen the way that it did. Further proof that Rowling is a master of shock treatment in a story!! Haha. Can\\'t wait to read the seventh and last book now., [...], BEST book of the series =), I love the Harry Potter series. :3, ** spoiler alert ** \\n Dumbledore :(, Those who have started know what a great series this is. This is a fantastic story for literally any age! Be sure to read the books in order, as the author truly uses detail to enhance the magic of the tale. Magic, valiant heroes and evil villains, staunch friendships, and wonderful mischief scamper through the halls of Hogwarts - Harry\\'s wizarding school - as a Rowling shows you life through the eyes of a courageous young boy., This book always makes me cry oh my god. Never gets old., Another strong volume of harry potter\\'s adventures ; an absolutely terrific addition to the series., wow...totally amazing...still read the series sometimes when I am feeling nostalgic about our magical childhood days, Favorite book of the entire series., I read the first Harry Potter when it came out and I was completely and utterly in love with the series. Along the way I forgot, or perhaps recovered from Potteriosis. This was not a good thing. I read up until the Order of the Phoenix and bowed out. Lately I have been feeling the odd Potteriosis stirrings and I am glad to say I obeyed and read the whole series including this one and the next one. \\n Unfortunately the magic might have dulled a bit...I couldn\\'t call back the mindless passion of my Potteriosis beginnings. Although this book was entertaining, gripping and engaging...something was missing. I am not sure what. All the same a lovely lovely book. I had fun reading it, and that is why it gets 5 stars., Ok, I saw the movie first, I know right? But to say the movie didn\\'t do the book justice is a serious overstatement. I am not sure the creen writer even read this book. There were not a handful of silly, pointless dialogue items dropped from the screenplay, but entire chunks of story, or leaving out events that progress the overall series story. Seriously? This book wa ssimilar to the fourth (Goblet of fire) In that it was a good read from begining to end, and the pace kept buolding until the end when it just crashed over you. I thought there were moments that were light as well as serious and in general, a good overall story., After rereading this, it\\'s still my absolute favorite in the series. Harry and the others begin their sixth year and Harry is dealing with the aftermath of what happened in the ministry. This one is my favorite because throughout the school year Harry begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort when he was known as Tom Riddle and I loved it. I loved learning about Voldemorts origins and how they were a little similar to Harry\\'s. I liked how Dumbledore began to trust Harry a little more that eventually he is able to help Dumbledore on his mission. I also enjoyed the mystery of the half blood prince. I remember the first time I read it I was so shocked but now reading it again I could see what I missed. This book also dealt with Harry, Ron and Hermoine and their love lives. This was the first time the pairings began and I didn\\'t remember Harry actually dating Ginny. I still want Harry and Hermoine together and despite the last book I will always picture them. I was so happy to reread this and I\\'m looking forward to the last one!, I gave this a 9/10 for the sheer fun of enjoying reading it. For me, Harry Potter stopped being fun with the last book and it was good to get that back again. However, when I stop to think about it (or listen to my husband talking about the book), there really wasn\\'t a lot of plot here. I enjoyed at adventure, but we didn\\'t progress the overall story very far. \\n I don\\'t want to spoil this for anyone (one major event was spoiled for me and I was very annoyed about it) which means I can\\'t really go into what I thought about some of the details, forcing this to be a particularly short review. But I guess mostly I enjoyed the story and I\\'ll wait to see if my quibbles are going to be resolved in the last book before complaining too loud. \\n [Copied across from Library Thing; 16 October 2012], re-read this after watching the Deathly Hallows Part I to get holes filled in. It was better the second time around., So good. So sad. I can\\'t wait to read the Deathly Hallows, but I really don\\'t want it to be over. :(, A great book continuation on the Harry Potter series. It\\'s nice that everyone believes him now, it drove me bonkers in the fifth. Even though the ending was sad, it went right with the seventh novel., OH MY CLARK GABLE I CANNOT EVEN RIGHT NOW, NO ONE TALK TO ME., :(((((((, The best of all the Harry Potter books, and quite possibly the best book of our time., Loved it as usual. :) This makes about the 10th or 15th time that I have read it., The world of Harry Potter will never be the same after this book!!, Reread Number 3, Who doesn\\'t love the Harry Potter Books? Not me -- I LOVE this series and appreciate JK Rowling\\'s tremendous contribution to reading for younger ages. This book continues the amazing saga and is definitely worth reading., Re-reading this book for the first time since it\\'s initial launch was an absolute joy. \\n Somewhere over the years the last three Potter books had merged in my mind into an angst filled, bloated ending to the series that while still being excellent was a definite drop off from the early books. While Order Of The Phoenix confirmed this feeling The Half-Blood Prince tore it apart. \\n Seemingly learning from some of the missteps in Phoenix, Rowling reigns things in a bit here, creating a more focused narrative while still having enough space to develop some of the relationships which come to define the series. \\n Prince absolutely retains the magical feeling and mystery filled storytelling of the early books while telling a darker tale. While it lacks some of the social commentary from Phoenix I feel it\\'s a very worthwhile trade off., I\\'m obsessed with all things Potter right now, in anticipation of the November 19 opening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. \\n And to further prove that I\\'m a Potter geek, I have the day off for the opening of the movie. \\n Oh yes-- I\\'ve purchased my ticket :), I\\'m just really mad and upset right now, WHY!! MY HEART IS BROKEN. THANKS FOR CRUSHING MY HEART J.K ROWLING!!! :(, I really want to give this 1star because of the end. But I can\\'t. \\n I just finished this and I can\\'t even write a proper review right now. This book deserves to sit in the corner and think about what it\\'s done. \\n I\\'m just going to go cry now. Maybe for a couple of days. \\n And Harry, YOU IDIOT. GINNY AND YOU ARE PERFECT. \\n Hopefully Lupin got it together and came to his senses and he and Tonks will be together. Yeah. Silly, foolish Harry, thinking it was Tonks and Sirius. I never believed it. \\n But finally, a DADA teacher has stayed! \\n I seriously am just going to cry now., Feels., This book actually upset me for a time. The plot for the horuxes was well developed, however, Rowling\\'s depiction of teenage relationships left much to be desired and caused me to put the book on my shelf in disgust for half a year before finishing it., I\\'ve enjoyed all of the Potter books so far. This one was just as good as the others. The ending was a little depressing and was very upset by it but I feel it was part of Rowling\\'s plan so I have dealt with it. Can\\'t wait for the next one!!!, once again this book made me cry. i balled like a baby. dumbledore was the last thing keeping harry there. now hes gonna go off trying to be the hero. at least the whiney harry from book 5 is gone. and he knows how he feels about ginny. took long enough!!!, i read this book to fulfill the goal read \"a book by author from a country you never visited \" This has become my favorite harry potter book so far. i\\'m so glad i conquered my fear and tried this series. i have gone from skeptical to iffy to a huge fan. this experience has gone a long way to helping me conquer my fear of trying new things. I can\\'t wait to see how it ends., Dark - but not nearly as brooding as the previous - Half-Blood Prince is memorable as one of the funniest in the series despite its war-time setting. While the atmosphere and events are no laughing matter, the adolescent dialogue is full of witty asides and wickedly funny commentary on teenage love, mayhem, and magic., This is probably my least read Harry Potter book, and I had a really good time going through and re-reading it! I think its the perfect transion book to get us to where we need to be in book 7, without overwhelming us with too many new plot details. In fact its a much simpler story than both GoF and OOTP, but I think thats what it needed to b. I really loved going through all of Dumbledors memories again, and of course the part when they are they are in the cave always makes me shiver!, My favorite thus far!!, Probably my favorite in the series so far. I\\'m currently crying but I loved it so much., I did not plan on reading this on april but i did anyway. Someome on Twitter spoilt this for me so i knew what was going to happen. Nevertheless it\\'s a 5 star book for me because guys, it\\'s harry potter. \\n :\\'(, Snape!, I ugly cry while reading and watching it...... It hurts ........, This might actually top the Deathly Hallows simply because of character development. Sure, we got answers to our questions in Deathly Hallows, but this one we got to learn about Voldemort and compare him to Harry, and I love learning the origin story of the villain., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Dumbledore dies., I can never get enough of Harry Potter, This was the darkest book in the series. At the end of it you feel completely helpless but it so worth it when your read the last book. However you must read this book to know how the series ends. there is a lot of information in this book., Definitely another really good book. I loved every part of it., The ending was very sad but overall very good book and incredibly told story through masterful story telling., One of my top favorite books from the harry potter series. So much suspense, jealousy, love....so on.I prefer the book over the movie, though. This is one of my favorite books of all time, and I give J.K Rowling a standing ovation!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n loved it! \\n The emotion is more intense than on last books, we can feel how Harry has grown. The last chapters were quite devastating, I suprised myself tearing a tear for something that I knew would happen (I already saw the movie), Omg, this was such a good book!! I cried so much. I\\'m not ready for this series to end., Sa jakla sorgligt och bra!, I just love it <3, Totally loved it !!!, Skipped the 5th one as I\\'d recently re-read that. And my copy seems to be missing anyway., My favorite volume of the series, in both book and movie. LOVE., , After having seen the movie, I expected this book to go by really slow and be just as a dissappointment as the movie. Surprisingly, this book held my interest the entire time and gave me some very necessary information in order to complete the series with full understanding and entertainment. I loved this book. It went beyond my expectations. J. K. Rowling is a wonderous author. I recommend for everyone who has read the other books in the series and is desperate for more Harry Potter books to read., Loved it! My preteen and I still have discussions about this one and all the others in the Harry Potter series. Reading YA fiction with her keeps us in touch., \"Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?\" \\n \"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly. \\n \"Yes, sir.\" \\n \"There\\'s no need to call me \\'sir\\', Professor.\" \\n * \\n This is excellent one. I love Harry Potter so much and this one is one of my faves. It\\'s so full of emotions and funny at the same time and I cried my eyes out and.. ugh! I can\\'t say how much I love this!, So much feels., This was simultaneously my favorite and my least favorite of the series, and this was because it seemed to be split into two entirely different books. On one side of the split, we\\'re finally getting answers about the origins of Voldemort and fleshing out the central action-plot. On the other side, it\\'s like reading a fanfic by a sixteen-year-old. One of the things I liked best about Rowling\\'s style in the earlier books was that she was able to stay above her fans\\' need for romantic focus. In the sixth book, whenever Harry wasn\\'t gallivanting through memories with Dumbledore, he and the other characters were entirely wrapped up in a Degrassi-style teenage soap opera. Frankly, it cheapened the characters I\\'d grown to love. \\n My feelings on this book are half-and-half. I loved the Harry and Dumbledore scenes, but I could have done without the hormones., I loved this book. The last three are my favorite. It is hard to talk about this one without mentioning things from the 7th. It is very sad towards the end, and as someone who grew up on these books, rereading it just made me sad that it was almost over., 4 1/2 Stars. Where the previous installment relies heavily on rousing emotions to propel it forward, this one relies more on rousing curiosity. The result is a nicely calm albeit lengthy bridge from the intense emotions that accompany a large chunk of the Order of the Phoenix to the intense emotions that end the Half-Blood Prince. Beyond that, I cannot say much of what I have not already said in reviews of previous books in the series. Rowling continues to constrict my heart and wring out my eyes with her emotional shockers, and her ingenious development of characters has honestly put me at a loss for words. I am all-together eager, anxious, enthusiastic, and terrified to read the final book., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Dumbledores death gets me every single time. I need some tissues., Perfect., The books in the Harry Potter series simply improve and darken in each following book., en definitiva uno de los mejores libros que he leido, ha sido toda una experiencia, todo un viaje, toda una aventura \\n Se gana un puesto muy alto entre mis favoritos y sin duda (al momento) mi favorito dentro de la saga. \\n He llorado mares al leer los ultimos capitulos, he aprendido mucho sobre las personas al leerlo y aun no me puedo explicar como es que he tardado tanto en proponerme a leer esta maravillosa saga. \\n J.K. Rowling me ha estrujado el corazon mas de una vez y se que no sera diferente con el libro restante, pero de la misma manera he tenido el placer de leer una historia extraordinaria, Quite a wait for this one. Was it worth it. Errm. I\\'m still undecided on how I feel about this one! Granted more funny moments, which is always a plus. Also a lot more action in this. Does a perfect job of setting us up for the big finale!, Goes In A Closet And Cries For 30 Mins. Bye, Wow that was so good., Snape, ** spoiler alert ** \\n De longe o livro mais entediante da serie. As tarefas de cozinhar personagens e despachar Dumbledore poderiam ter sido feitas com um pouco mais de esmero e, principalmente, acao. Estamos no meio de uma guerra ja declarada, e no entanto a unica pitada de tensao nesse livro sao mortes citadas! Rowling nunca havia falhado em deixar os leitores curiosos e nervosos. Este livro, porem (talvez fruto de pressao pelos prazos ou mesmo comodismo pela fidelidade dos fas), e o unico da jornada de Harry Potter que deixa a desejar., Kinda slow. Not as exciting as the rest. Too many long pages of dialog., This is my favorite Harry Potter book, and I\\'ve loved it every time that I\\'ve read it! I\\'m not much for re-reading, but I read this one a 3rd time with my younger son. I think I liked it best the 2nd time, but it\\'s definitely worth reading 3 times. The movie doesn\\'t do it justice, although it\\'s not bad., 5/5 happily - the marked improvement as the series goes on in writing style, characters, plot and sheer enjoyment is astonishing. What started out as a real kiddy-pleaser in the first two novels, the Harry Potter series is a really gripping series which i\\'m sure would terrify most of the younger readers picking these books up one after another. \\n One of the best things about HBP is the increase in dialogue Dumbledore gets - he\\'s a wonderful character, incredibly old and revered the wizarding-world over but acting more like a mischievous child as he speaks little asides to Harry. Add into the mix spells that bring the dead to life and a clash of \\'ministers\\' as the UK\\'s Prime Minister meets the Minister of Magic and the day-to-day life at Hogwarts hardly gets a look-in. The typical Quidditch match-up takes a real back seat as Harry, although now Gryffindor\\'s captain has to endure Malfoy\\'s wrath and a new-found celebrity status he\\'d really rather not have. Saying that, a latent love interest becomes more centre stage in this novel and Harry makes time for that :) \\n Voldemort\\'s history is unravelled in a series of lessons Harry undertakes as the book goes on, it\\'s quite a good technique to reveal parts of the story in flashback and acts as an interesting suspenseful counterpoint to the myriad of things going on in the main story. As the story unravels and the book edges towards the search for the Horcrux, you realise you\\'re really not in a kids book any more. Very good indeed., I still don\\'t like this one as much as the others. it honestly seemed like there were a number of different plotlines going on, which is okay, I guess, but they weren\\'t really related and they were bouncing around quite a lot. It was good that the climax held for all of them, though. Thsi book could just have easily been called \\'Harry Potter and his friend\\'s sister\\', \\'Harry Potter and Malfoy is up to SOmething\\', \\'Harry Potter and the History of Voldemort\\', \\'harry Potter and dumbledore is actually telling harry something for a change\\', \\'Harry Potter and Ron\\'s crush\\', \\'Harry potter and the quidditch cup\\', or \\'Harry Potter and Hermione is right, as usual\\'. It was about these other things just as musch as it was about teh half-Blood prince, possibly more. \\n I admit, Harry got over many of his flaws in this one. He stopped yelling at everyone all teh time, he told people the stuff they needed to know, he stopped crushing on Cho Chang. All issues I had with him in former books. But it did seem a bit like he matured all at once. Which doesn\\'t happen. \\n I\\'m glad he got with Ginny, though. And Ron\\'s reaction was perfect. I would have liked a little more showing what actually happened, there was a lot of \"this week was great\", \"he was thinking about a nice hour he had spent\" \"he was very happy\"...etc. I would have liked a little more of it actually happening and a little less telling in retrospect. \\n I was dissapointed in this climax. Not only was it dissapointing no matter how well it was written, but i was dissapointed in the futileness of the Horcrux thing. Also i thought that the climax was odly detached form the rest of the book. it was kind of llike \"Oh lets go have a climax...GO\" It didn\\'t even try to ease into it. plus it bugs me that everyone is wrong, becasue i like there to be someone that is right in teh story, but when Harry, Hermione, and Professor McGonagall are all wrong, there is something going on. \\n One Note: This sounds naive. but why doesn\\'t The portrait of Dumbledore count for anything? Don\\'t portraits have memories, knowledge, and the ability to talk? Can\\'t Dumbledore\\'s Portrait just keep on being headmaster and giveing harr his lessons? What is the difference??? I am having issues with this. \\n One rant: IT IS NEVER SNAPE!!!! WHEN WILL THE ENTIRE CAST GET THIS THROUGH THEIR THICK SKULLS?? and why couldn\\'t there at least be one person who is still sure he\\'s good. That would ahve been better. \\n I wish Hermione\\'s and Ron\\'s stupid arguments didnt\\' have to last entire books. That is not realistic. If you stay mad at eachother that long, you aren\\'t making up. This was like 7 months, which is amplified in Boarding school time. It doesn\\'t work like that. And why are they both so stupid and selfish. They need to be there for Harry!! They are causing him just one more source of anxiety that he sure as heck doesn\\'t need right now. They need to buck up and be there for Harry, whether they are besties or not. Or jsut fall in love already. That would be good too. \\n Is there a difference between a hex, a curse, and a jinx? because I thought they were all sort of slightly different, distinct things, but they seem to be used interchangebly., I\\'m still crying :(, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no \\n ps: why can\\'t they just talk to Dumbledore through his portrait in the headmaster\\'s office though?? #confused, *reread* (originally finished 2010), ** spoiler alert ** \\n Had a hard time getting into this one, better than the fifth one. But for real. DUMBLEDORE DIES?!?!?! My life, Apparently I read this pretty quickly? Well, there\\'s a reason for that: it was great! It totally redeemed the last book, as this novel was far more exciting, had less aggravating characters, and it wasn\\'t as depressing as its predecessor (ok, the ending actually made me sad, I will admit, though I knew it was coming before I even read the series). \\n There was one aspect of the novel that made me scoff quite a few times, and that was the teenage drama. Now, not to say that I wasn\\'t the same way when I was in high school (you know, shy to ask someone out, obsessing over the one tiny smile the cute guy gave me), but when you\\'re 27, like I am, you just want to tell 16-year-olds to \"ASK THEM OUT FOR LOVE OF ZEUS\". Seriously, it\\'s not a big deal at all. Hell, when you\\'re my age you can tell if someone wants in your pants just by catching their eye and raising an eyebrow. But when you\\'re 16, it is a big deal to tell someone you fancy them. And Rowling did a great job making their little dramas entirely realistic and therefore endearing. I think there was just enough of the drama to make Harry and friends out to be typical teenagers (because if they were all stoics and not interested in making out it would be laughably unrealistic), but not enough that I shook the book and was like \"ENOUGH ALREADY.\" \\n Oh, and I totally called Tonks being in love with Lupin , but that\\'s probably because I have a wee crush on him myself! \\n ANYWAY, drama aside, the book moved at a great pace. Clearly I couldn\\'t put it down. Likewise, the last hundred pages was a great climax - a mystery was solved, another mystery was introduced, a battle took place... and as such, it was a really good precursor to the last book. Hell, I\\'m going to start Deathly Hallows as soon as I\\'m done work. \\n A couple things were a little obvious. The identity of the Half-Blood Prince? Figured that out from the get-go (I mean, come on, who else would have the time [due to having no friends] to annotate an entire book, and who else grew up to become the POTIONS professor? ). And despite what he did, this particular character still tugs on my heartstrings. \\n I wish I had read this series years ago., Wow! this one was interesting from the get go, that i like. Unlike the 5th book, this one did not drag on at all. It was intense, it had way more answers to a lot of questions I had from the previous books. i just didnt expect one of the most important characters to be killed. Sad indeed, but not as sad as Siriu\\'s death. Cant wait to read the last book and find out wether Harry\\'s able to defeat voldemort, Loved this one. They just keep getting better as the series goes on., I have just finished reading and I\\'m shocked. Really, these books get better and better one after the other! This 6th book, as Harry and the other get older, gets more intense and deep. Harry is not the inocent guy he was before and starts experiencing new feelings, like real hate, and love. I won\\'t say more but I liked to see this more human Harry - it started on the 5th book of course, and goes through this one - instead of the all good inocent Harry from the first books. Can\\'t see what waits for the on the last book! \\n Just one little weird thing : I thought Dumbledore a little bit arrogant. Will I find an answer for this on the next book? Let\\'s see!, This may be my favorite Harry Potter book. I love the sections with Voldemort\\'s backstory - they really help you understand him. Learning about the Horcruxes is really shocking, for the reader as much as Harry. It\\'s nice to see Harry and Dumbledore\\'s trust in each other grow (sob). I also like that everyone finally pairs up in this book, even if it\\'s after some angst (the Ron and Lavender scenes always make me laugh). The mystery of the identity of the half-blood prince - and the reveal at the end - also elevate the book, as does the tension-filled climax in the cave. And of course, the end is just so sad. It still breaks my heart, even after having reread it many times. \\n The book does a good job setting up everything for the grand finale!, Although I\\'ve read enough reviews by people I respect to figure I\\'d be ok with the books, I did want to read them as my kids did, so that we could talk over any potential problems or issues. And so, this spring, I tore through the seven volumes in quick succession (that and empty carbs seemed like the only things I could stomach due to morning sickness) and found I quite liked them. \\n If you do have topical or thematic concerns with the books, I\\'d encourage you to read them before you make up your mind. Personally I found them to be much more about how to handle being different, how to make good decisions when evil seems easier, and the importance of taking advice from wiser authority figures than any of the concerns I\\'ve heard. I made notes as I read so that I could identify all of the topics I thought would make for good discussion, and I appreciated the many examples of bravery, integrity, taking a stand for what\\'s right, and so on. I also liked how the stories ring true in the characterization of middle school/high school aged kids, and also take a firm line against the stereotypical sappy/drippy teen angst thing (several characters confront each other when tempted to indulge in martyr complexing and pity partying). \\n I do think the books increase in difficulty and complexity as the series progresses. However, the series is pretty engrossing, so I think it makes for a good stretch if you have a kid who can handle the first two books but might need to reach a bit for the later ones. \\n {You can read my longer review of the whole Harry Potter series, as well as comments on timing and age range for kids reading the books, on A Spirited Mind}, When looking back at the Harry Potter series, it\\'s easy to skip over the importance of The Half-Blood Prince, because it\\'s followed by the climax of the saga, the very last novel. Rereading this book once again I am struck by how much it accomplishes and how well it does it, from the affirmation of love in its many forms (\"All these scars show is zat my husband is brave!\") to the steady building of a sense of true danger (\"Anyone else we know died?\"), from the passing of the torch from mentor to student (\"I am not worried, Harry... I am with you.\") to meditating on free will, responsibility, and mercy (\"\\'I haven\\'t got any options!\\' said Malfoy.\"; \"I\\'m not coming back even if it does reopen...\"). I greatly appreciate the melancholy tone of this particular novel as it notes that our protectors aren\\'t invincible, our unexamined assumptions are often wrong, and our circumstances sometimes demand that we grow up more quickly than we would wish. A very fallible Harry takes a crucial step from the defensive to the offensive, from following to leading, and Rowling charts his course in a very compelling way. \\n Knowing what we later discover about the Half-Blood Prince (which makes revisiting this novel twice as meaningful), I can\\'t reread this book without thinking of a quote by St. John Climacus: \"It has happened that men have sinned greatly in the open, but done good deeds in secret, so that those who would disparage them have been fooled, with smoke instead of sunlight in their eyes.\" \\n If you haven\\'t read or reread this one in a while, I highly recommend it., LOVE[?][?], #cryingrealtears It\\'s still not easy to read this even when you know it\\'s coming because you\\'ve read it before...multiple times.... \\n Re-reading before the Cursed Child\\'s release on 7/31/16!, Phew! done. Much better than #5 and actually makes me eager to start #7., Of course, 5 stars., I really loved this book, specialy because I\\'m a Romione fan and this story is full of it. \\n In this book, J.K. Rowling shows us how the story grows up with Harry and his friends and the advance of Voldemort\\'s power. Harry, together with Dumbledore, walks into Tom Riddle\\'s memories and looks into how to destroy the horrocruxes in his next adventure. \\n An exciting story full of different matters like love, friendship, revenge and magic, of course!, This book is very long, slow and dry. It took me months to read it! I wouldn\\'t go as far as to say I didn\\'t like it but I didn\\'t enjoy it as much as the previous books. Series have a way of making you feel like you have to trudge through all of them though, for fear of missing something. At least the last couple of chapters were good., I thought this was the best of the lot. Very gripping. Not much else to say about HP that hasn\\'t already been said., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Heartbreaking and Fabulous \\n (Best BOOK,WORST movie) \\n ^_^ \\n +Half-Blood Prince is my favorite book and other than 7, the darkest book in the series. though each is a masterpiece. Full of great moments in the story. I felt that I was learning more and at a quicker rate than in Order of the Phoenix. \\n +It must be that Rowling, in her grand scheme, is saving much for the last book. One thing seems to be for certain, though, and that is that J.K. Rowling will never lose that special touch, that supreme and genuine interest in the story and its characters that makes the writing so engrossing. After completing this book, I was in a state of total shock and to this moment I wish only to read the seventh book. \\n +Half-Blood Prince is dark; I mean far darker than the last. Several of the chapters are particularly well-written, with great suspense and imagery;Relationships blossom in this book at last, haha i will not TELL,BUT i was engrossed in Harry\\'s LOVE LIFE,at the same time disappointed haha LOL because it\\'s a bit short,not just Harry\\'s LOVE STORY but other CHARACTERS as well. \\n +Much of the book is devoted to Harry witnessing important memories in the Pensieve with Dumbledore so that he can gain a greater understanding of his enemy, the Dark Lord. ;) \\n +Revealing more on SNAPE\\'S story.hmmm,i\\'m a bit fan of Severus Snape,though i HATE him for DOiNG SOMETHING REALLY REALLY BAD & unexpected, T_T RESULTiNG of MOST SHOCKING PART of this book.One of the MAiN CHARACTER DIED.I was so sad & teary-eyed,to the point i READ again that part not believing it really happened. I was expecting a surprising reason for Dumbledore to trust Snape, not a simple apology. There must still be more to this than meets the eye. \\n +The end of the book is unbelievably sad and depressing.When you grow with Harry Potter it\\'s definitely a blast. \\n +If you haven\\'t guessed my opinion on \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" yet, I\\'ll say that I highly recommend it. Run to get your copy, if you don\\'t already have one, and share the magic :) \\n +LASTLY, \\n +\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" is amazing. It is mature and moving and is by far the best book in the series so far. There are a lot of open-ended questions that are leading up to Book Seven...will Harry and his friends return to Hogwarts for their final year? Will there even be a Hogwarts to go back to? How on earth will Harry manage the impossible task that lies ahead of him? One thing\\'s for certain...I can\\'t wait to find out! Blimey!!! \\n Let\\'s READ the LAST PART of the BOOK \\n Shall we??? or not???, Cannot form proper sentence at the moment. \\n What. Even. \\n AHHHHHH! \\n Ok, now that that\\'s out of the way, onto HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE. \\n I\\'m going to go over the points that I thought were pretty significant: \\n 1. Voldemort\\'s past \\n -This was honestly one of my favorite parts of the entire book. I\\'ve been waiting up to this point to get a closer look into Voldemort\\'s life and what made him into who he eventually became. We had an idea about his childhood from previous books but we never got an upfront personal look like we did in this one. I couldn\\'t help but feel a little bit of pity for him, really. Growing up in a lonely orphanage and never really knowing love in his life. Doesn\\'t excuse all the shit he\\'s done of course, but at least now we kind of sort of get it. \\n 2. Snape \\n -Pretty much since Sorcerer\\'s Stone I\\'ve had my qualms and suspicions of Snape. Not only is he very unlikable, but it\\'s almost impossible to know what side he\\'s on! Everytime you think you\\'ve got him figured out he turns around and just throws it all back in your face. I hate him, but he is such a great character. The moral ambiguity coupled along with never really knowing where his true allegiance lies makes for a very complex character. However.....I don\\'t know if I can forgive him after this. (More on this later.) \\n 3. Draco Malfoy \\n -Up until this time in the series the development of Draco has been a little underwhelming for me. I\\'ve been waiting to see a side to him that had more substance than just the rich brat. We saw a darker side to him in this book and it wasn\\'t pretty. If anything, I feel sorry for Draco more than I hate him. Growing up in the environment and family that had such a narrow and hateful mentality shaped him to be the person he is, and it is this that ultimately leads him down the wrong path. Just like his parents. While he\\'s not a particularly a nice person, I don\\'t think he is evil. I mean, he ultimately could not go through with his task and I believe he truly would have allowed Dumbledore to help him if the circumstances were different. \\n 4. Dumbledore\\'s death \\n -Oh my goodness, this was so upsetting. I couldn\\'t believe what I was reading. HOW IN THE WORLD CAN THE MOST POWERFUL WIZARD IN THE WORLD DIE?! I didn\\'t realize how connected I felt to Dumbledore until he died, really. His strength and power was as potent as was his heart of gold and it is always hard to see such a great person meet his end in that way. I couldn\\'t believe Snape. After how much Dumbledore trusted him, how could he betray him in that way? I feel like there might be some kind of twist with this in the last book but I still don\\'t think I\\'m ever going to like Snape, as a person anyway. \\n *There is so much more to say. SO MUCH MORE. But if I start I don\\'t think I\\'ll stop. Bottom line, such a great book and I definitely found it easier to get through than Order of the Phoenix. I can\\'t believe I\\'m almost done with this series. Very bittersweet. I wish it could last forever., I think J.K Rowling covered the pages with love potion because I absolutely loved this book and every time I read it it keeps it\\'s magic, AMAZING!, SPEECHLESS..., Toujours un plaisir de suivre les aventures de Harry et c\\'est encore mieux lorsque Dumbledore est bien present !, The series has a complex and interesting storyline, that keeps you interested from beginning to end., amazing book- to bad they messed up the movie on this one!!, Finally reading Harry Potter for the first time! I can\\'t believe I\\'m almost to the end. How sad., After his struggles, he found himself in the office of Dumbledore teaching about the dangers and the past of Voldemort., ** spoiler alert ** \\n This might be my favorite in the series, but the jury is out on that since I\\'ve read the last one only once, and I flew through it so fast I can barely remember parts of it. As for this book, the snogging stuff gets a little annoying, but the overall story is great. This book also has my favorite scene in the series which is where Snape hands Harry his ass in a duel. Snape is probably my favorite character in the series overall, and he\\'s featured rather prominently in this one., It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" \\n A masterpiece, that\\'s all., Fav scenes. \\n #1. Draco scenes. \\n #2. memory scenes. \\n #3. the ending....you know what i mean. Hate me if you want., This is the book where it all came together for me. I realized what the series was building up to, and I was uber-impressed. Horcruxes and their implications - the whole thing is genius. My only gripe is Ginny and Harry\\'s relationship/attraction could\\'ve been more flushed out. But just like stomping out adverbs, it\\'s not JK Rowling\\'s strong point. Rowling is so good about letting Harry make mistakes, but still make him likable. \\n In this book, Harry learns about Voldemort\\'s horcruxes and about Voldemort himself based on memories from the pensieve. It\\'s Harry\\'s job to get one vital memory from Professor Slughorn, but Harry is slacking on the job. Meanwhile, two students get nearly killed, and Harry is certain is has something to do with Draco Malfoy. Harry believes Malfoy has become a deatheater and has a special assignment, and that Snape is trying to help him. \\n It ends in a great place to get us ready for book 7., Reread the ending and it kills me every time..., Not my favorite of the series, but it still held strong to the Harry Potter name. While the plot was still as engaging, it was harder for me to become as interested in the plot. It was great getting to know the story behind Voldemort and to learn about the horcruxes. I think the reason why I didn\\'t like this book as much was because of what sadly happens at the end :(, I picked up the book at about 10:30 a.m. on the day it came out and finished it at about 4:30 p.m. the next day! I was originally going to try to stretch it out and make it last, since there is only one left after this, but unfortunately that plan didn\\'t work. Lots of interesting developments in this one, including a long-expected death (well, at least to anyone who knows anything about myth structure). I\\'ll be curious to see how the last book picks up from here., 7th book of 2017 - (5 stars) ~finished february 8, 2017~ \\n still great :) \\n update: february 8, 2017 \\n honestly still don\\'t understand why people didn\\'t love this book. i loooooooved it <3 \\n also the goodreads rereading function-thanks :) \\n update: march 6, 2016: \\n reading this series again in the wrong order makes me happy :), HP re-read 2015. \\n This is one of my faves in the series. And still brings me to tears. \\n <3, Such a touching book :\\'-), Probably the best of the Potter books. Cried at the end all over again., Maybe it\\'s the Harry Potter Book with biggest revelation and maddest turn of event. Personally, I will always think of this book as the account of Harry\\'s last year in Hogwarts., This book picks up right where The Order of the Phoenix left off! There\\'s so much to this book, it\\'s hard to know where to begin. As I read it, I found myself able to relate to several of the characters and I would become frustrated for each them as they tried to make themselves understood. The story itself was very engaging; so much so, it was difficult to put it away. There were several evenings when I stayed up entirely too late in order to read one more chapter!, I love these books so much!!!!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n \"Do you remember me telling you we are practicing non-verbal spells, Potter?\" \\n \"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly. \\n \"Yes, sir.\" \\n \"There\\'s no need to call me \"sir\" Professor.\" \\n The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying.\", Wow. that\\'s all i can say right now. Wow., Rereading Harry Potter makes me realize why it is so many people\\'s favorite series. Mine included. This second read through is even more amazing than the first. My ranking after this book. \\n 1. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince \\n 2. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire \\n 3. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban \\n 4. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix \\n 5. Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone \\n 6. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Seems it lost the date on when I first read it. /sigh. Oh well. This is my 3rd read - this time, audio book read by Jim Dale., Como no amar este libro, si estan oscuro y fuerte, lleno de amistad y un poco de romance, aventura y peleas., Not the best of the series as Harry is obsessed with Draco and it\\'s filled with teenage romance., Some of my favorite books of all time! I\\'ve read the whole series multiple times., This book is when I feel like the series started to take a majorly dark turn. It\\'s so intense and depressing at some points (you all know exactly which part it is too) but as with all of the books, it still keeps me enthralled and wanting more., I will never be the same again. Sooo good!, OMG !! .. the ENDING !! \\n I liked this book so much .. we got to know more about Voldemort and hate Snape even more .. I am really REALLY shocked .. and now I can say \\n The Ending Has Begun :), , Oh my god. What the hell just happened ?! My heart broke into a million pieces and the love I had had for Harry Potter, which I thaught couldn\\'t get any bigger, bc the human heart is not able to love something that much, just grew so much bigger. I don\\'t believe that J.K. Rowling is a human being, bc a human is not able to create something as wonderful as Harry Potter <3, Awesome, Loved this one the twist and turns is this chracter good or bad wont know till you read the 7th book, It\\'s Harry Potter. It\\'s genius incarnate. It\\'s perfect... Need I say more?, I am terribly troubled with how much has changed when transitioning this beautiful book to the big screens, but am happy that I was able to really walk through the pages of another Harry Potter book. \\n I\\'m not gonna lie, I did have a few tears getting ready to fall when I read the about the funeral, it was just so beautiful, and my heart screamed when Fleur declared her love for Bill after the incidents that I will not spoil!, This is my favorite Harry Potter book so far. Even though I had heard about someone dying, it still hit me like a ton of bricks. I\\'m so sad I only have one more book to read!, This book is more tightly written than the last one. Rowling seems to have taken a little more time to evaluate what to include in the book and what to leave out. This book has a faster pace than the last one and even though it\\'s quite long it doesn\\'t seem as long as it is. Rowling focuses on character development and relationships more in this book too. The wizarding world is at war in this book and because of that there is some disturbing imagery., This one is my favorite so far I think., One of the best books in the series, a little less action packed then the others but still very good, and the characters really develop in this book., Just great, adored this books like the others. Harry Potter will always be a series that I\\'ll never get tired of rereading and this is only the second time I read it, the first time was in French, my native language. \\n (I\\'m not an English-speaking don\\'t hesitate to correct me if needs be), *reread April 2016*, Why hello old friends. It was good to see and sad to let some of you go., Aaaah the feels, the heartbreak !, I love this series. It is starting to get darker when Draco is involved as a Death Eater. I dislike that his friends refuse to believe him about Draco, but I also don\\'t like how Harry acts disrespectful to some people. I mean he may not like Snape (and I didn\\'t either in the beginning) but he should act more respectful. I appreciate how Harry becomes Captain of Quiddith- as I knew he would., Reread Sept. 2015, There isn\\'t much more to be said about any HP books, but that Jim Dale can read a story! He is THE best!!, Reread 2016: 5/5 stars (of course)! This books is incredible! Definitely closer to the top of my series ranking than I remembered. There are some big differences from the movie that I really enjoyed rediscovering (mainly Tom Riddle\\'s backstory). Now to rewatch the movie and then start Deathly Hallows! (Also super pumped for the Illustrated Edition of the Chamber of Secrets to come out on Tuesday!! I need it in my life.), Great story again and great sequences!, Exactly what fans would come to expect from J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter., Oh my god oh my god oh my god... I can\\'t handle the loss... please fellow fangirls I need help with my mourning period...I swear I can\\'t wait for snape to die, Harry goes about this tome with: \\n Malfoy-Ginny-Prince-Malfoy-Quiddich-Prince-Malfoy-Ginny-Quidditch-Voldemort\\'s origin story-Teen Angst-Quiddich-Ginny-Malfoy... \\n And in the usual JKR style, last 5 chapters is where things happen and end., Has to be one of the best I have read!, It was a book in the series. Good? Bad? I dunno. It was all right., Read: \\n July 2005 \\n February 16th 2007 \\n August 15th 2009 \\n March 21st 2010 \\n April 27th 2010 \\n May 27th 2010 \\n June 5th 2010 \\n July 2nd 2010 \\n September 1st 2010 \\n November 14th 2010 \\n December 31st 2010 \\n February 26th 2011 \\n April 21st 2011 \\n July 15th 2011 \\n May 6th 2012 \\n August 21st 2016, Sin duda, mi libro favorito hasta el momento. Ha cambiado todo, ya no nos encontramos con unos ninos que agitan sus varitas y se van de aventuras. Estos ninos han crecido y albergan temores mas serios, son adultos. \\n El final ha sido un torrente de emociones impresionante, aunque ya sabia como iba a acabar ha sido imposible contener la lagrimita. Absolutamente nada que ver con las peliculas, la belleza que aporta la autora con su escritura es sin duda alguna un punto muy a favor. \\n Con ganas de mas, pero sin ganas de terminar., 4.5 stars \\n I DON\\'T WANT IT TO BE REAL, IT\\'S NOT REAL dY~dY~ \\n WAAAH. \\n This sucks dude., Sept 4, 2017 - finished on audio. This one went very fast (also helped along by a road trip), and Jim Dale got to do many characters in younger form during flashbacks. The whole last couple hours of this were so harrowing. \\n \"And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour--or possibly several sunlit days--they broke apart.\" \\n \"[Harry thinks] how they had talked about fighting a losing battle, and that it was important to fight, and to fight again, and to keep fighting, to keep evil at bay, though never quite eradicated.\" \\n \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\" \\n \"There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to fear from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" \\n July 2007-ish: Okay, I\\'m now at the point everyone else was at when they couldn\\'t wait for midnight on July 21!! Although I\\'d already heard who dies at the end of this 6th book, I managed not to hear how it happens, and I was shocked -- shocked! This story is getting really scary (for a wimp like me), and certain scenes I wished I wasn\\'t reading alone at night! But lucky me, I get to open book 7 RIGHT NOW and not wait two years for closure! Here goes..., This was perfect book for this new and more dangerous side of the series. The first time I read it, let\\'s say I wasn\\'t happy about the way some things happened, but now I\\'m older and can understand better the path taken by the author to make the final book more dark. \\n I liked the story, but mostly the way Harry is finally making sense in his dangerous assumptions of evil. Hermione and Rony made me sad sometimes, because they weren\\'t believers, but Harry never questioned their friendship and I liked that in the final moment, they listened to Harry and made things better. \\n So this was a book to explain more about Lord Voldmort and make Harry understand what he has to fight, but most of all, this book showed a different side of Dumbledore and I liked that., No puedo con esto... A pesar de que ya me habia hecho muchos spoilers con varias revelaciones, me sorprendi como si no tuviera la menor idea. Te odio tanto Rowling :(, Beautiful, beautiful as always., You know. It\\'s just good. \\n Favorite Quotes \\n Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths. \\n Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth., Definitely the best book in the series so far. On to the next., WOW! This book involved a lot of action! I absolutely loved this book. I would recommend this book to you if you love action packed books for sure. Also make sure that you love fantasy, because this book is loaded with it., Love it[?] \\n I don\\'t have any words to said, I really really love it \\n All of the memories that dumbledore show to harry was amazing, The wizarding world is in an uproar. The evil Lord Voldemort is still alive, and his Death Eaters causing many \"disappearances\" of wizards and witches. Harry Potter has known this from the start; now, he must face the prophecy that was made - one day, he must destroy Voldemort. In the meantime, Harry and his friends return to Hogwarts - with many changes. Security has been increased on school grounds, the Ministry is doing everything they can to get to Professor Dumbledore, and Harry notices that Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape are acting very strangely. Could they be completing a task for Voldemort under Dumbledore\\'s nose? \\n And who is the Half-Blood Prince whose textbook Harry has found? \\n I enjoyed reading this book, and think that it had a major cliff-hanger ending that is causing readers to anticipate the July release of the final book. I can\\'t wait!, My very favourite out of all the series., This is me now. Of course I don\\'t have a Damon - shoulder to cry on but still... \\n So far this is my favourite HP book. It was so good, such a fast read and it made me laugh cringe and cry. I am so sad that my journey is almost over. But hey I have book 8 soon. I can\\'t believe I am onto book 7 already. Full review to come Oh and poor Hagrid and Fang. I hope all works out fine( hopefully) \\n So sad on Dumbledore\\'s death. So sad. I can\\'t. \\n Snape I hate you. \\n Shocked about Harry and Ginny \\n Remus and Tanks??!!!, I am so glad that I reread this book right before the last book, I think it helped me enjoy seven even more. It is not one of my favourites of the series, but it was definitely a springboard. One thing that I find Rowling did well (much to the chagrin of some of her readers) was create a teen character with angst. I think anyone who has gone through what Harry has would be equally as angry., re-read. I dislike Harry and Ginny getting together. One second he thinks her name and suddenly he likes her? I don\\'t get it. Besides that, everything else was wonderful, Go to http://joantsblog.blogspot.gr/ for my review!!!, Bof, dommage, My favorite of all the books., 5/5 stars {100%} i would have never thought this would be my favorite book in the entire series! I LOVEE IT! There was so much magic (obviously), laughter, drama, tears. Everything. I was literally crying in an elevator after reading this book and in a taxi. Xd. Amazing book., If i hadn\\'t known it was coming I would have cried so hard, we will see if I make it through the next book without sobbing., The whole book I was: OMG HARRY!! OMG Voldemort!! OMG Dracoooo!! OMG Dumbledore!!!!:0, I\\'m not okay with this, The war begins to escalate in this book, though Rowling keeps the reader in great suspense with so much of the plans of Voldemort either going on completely behind the scenes or just barely referenced to. In that way, it is a bit like the Order of the Phoenix, but this book is much better. The three kids, with the huge burden they are always carrying, are now just at the point of adulthood, and it is fascinating to see their transformations. This does not have the grand, over-arching plot line to carry us through the school year that some of the other books have (Chamber of Secrest, Sorceror\\'s Stone, Sirius Black, Goblet of Fire) but it\\'s all the better because of it. The history lessons into Voldemort from Dumbledore are quite possibly the most interesting part of all., Had to re-read this one before the movie comes out in July!, Having learned that English is not taught at Hogwarts, J. K. Rowling decided to take a course in grammar at a Muggle school before writing year six in the Harry Potter series. \\n The result is one of pure bliss and seems that the years that J. K. Rowling makes the decision to begin the year, not at the Dursely\\'s but at another location seems to be, in my opinion, better written and received a higher level. See year four as a comparison. \\n J. K. Rowling has taken a page out of: The Art of War by Sun Tzu, as Harry learns about Tom Riddle aka Voldemort through Harry meetings with Dumbledore. \\n Know your enemies and know yourself. \\n If you know your enemies but not yourself you may win or loose. This quote from the Art of War caused Dumbledore to be defeated as he put too much trust into professor Snape as Harry tried in a vain attempt to warn Dumbledore. \\n Harry\\'s friends also failed in this quote when they tried to counter Draco Malfoy. His use of the Peruvian darkness to sneak by the others. \\n All warfare is based on deception. \\n Snape and Draco knew this concept. Harry tried to uncover the deception that Malfoy was in a secret up to no good reason even though Harry\\'s friends somewhat reluctantly agreed. \\n This deception also occurred at the lake and one of Voldmorts trophies which caused Dumbledore to become weakened. \\n Harry is now alone, but he knows himself and he knows his enemy. \\n One slight note. \\n Harry Potter had been under Professor Snape teaching for five years and when Harry gets a potion book from professor Slughorn, he couldn\\'t recognize Snape\\'s handwriting., The book that broke millions of hearts and breaks them all over again every time it is re read. \\n A truly excellent book, which fills in a lot of the background to both Voldemort and Harry and answers many of the readers questions. It is the most wonderful and saddest of the series and my favourite in many ways as we see the moody teen step up and become a man under the most tragic of circumstances. \\n \" it is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more\" Dumbledore, A dear cousin of mine lent me the first in the series and swore that I would enjoy it, though I protested and just KNEW I was wasting my time. By page 15 or 20 I was hooked and by page 100 I was placing an order for all of the books available at the time. \\n Afterwards, I was one of the millions of dedicated fans chewing my fingernails to the bone, pacing the floors and waiting impatiently for the next installment. I would constantly check publishing/news sources for information pertaining to release dates and followed the trail of information being released in teasing/trickling tidbits greedily and by the time the new hardback came out I was practically foaming at the mouth. I pre-ordered as soon as it was possible to do so, paying extra freight expenses to have my book in my hand the absolute second it was humanly possible. \\n Mind you, I was 40 years old when all of this was going on; I was not some teen and part of the original target demographic group. But, I think that is what the cultural phenomenon surrounding these wonderful, SENSATIONAL novels is all about in the first place. The massive appeal hits home with everyone. From what I have read in the past, this series was originally intended for children and teens; but they hold a special kind of magical appeal that is highly addictive to everyone. \\n By the time the dust settled, I read every book at least thrice, owning copies in Hardback and Paperback and have also listed to and own the entire series in Audiotape and DVD. I share my love of literature with a beloved Aunt, now deceased; in her latter years she had gone legally blind and had to finish the last 3 books in audiotape. One of my fondest and most precious memories of her there \"near the end,\" was a weekend when she and I spent a Saturday and Sunday watching the entire Harry Potter DVD Movie series from beginning to end. I was nearing 50 and she was 83-there are no age requirements for Harry Potter, the only requirement is a vivid imagination, an open mind and the willingness to explore new worlds and/or boundaries. \\n GOD BLESS YOU, J.K. Rowling for this gift you have bestowed upon us., Verso la fine del libro incomincia un cambiamento radicale in questa magica storia: il passaggio dall\\'eta infantile all\\'eta adulta. Si puo notare sopratutto dall\\'atmosfera ombrosa che emanano le ultime cento pagine del libro, tutto diventa grigio e tetro e la speranza viene a mancare completamente. Non c\\'e piu la storia di quel ragazzino con gli occhiali e la cicatrice che insieme ai suoi amici cerca di vivere piu avventure possibili all\\'interno di Hogwarts. C\\'e la storia di un ragazzo, ormai cresciuto, che soffre e sa che quello che deve fare non e basato sulla voglia di cementarsi in nuove esperienze per pura passione e divertimento ma sul dovere di vendicare tutte le anime che sono state sottratte dalla sua vita,da quella dei suoi cari e soprattutto da quella dell\\'intero mondo magico e anche babbano. Harry diventa simbolo di forza per tutti, compresi noi lettori amanti di questa incantevole e meravigliosa serie (per non dire la piu incantevole e meravigliosa serie mia stata scritta)., Cada ve que leo un libro de esta saga estoy segura que es mi favorito, pero luego leo el que sigue y pienso lo mismo. Pero este libro... no tengo palabra para describir lo que me asombro y maravillo. Aun sigo rota emocionalmente, creo que jamas lo superare, pero J. K. Rowling ya se confirmo un espacio en mi lista de escritores favoritos. \\n No puedo amar mas esta saga., I learned that Harry is \"Dumbledore\\'s man through and through\" \\n :D <3, Buddy Re-Read continues! \\n I read this last almost the day after it originally came out and was amazed at the big reveals... Guess who Dies and guess who the Prince is! ... but more than that, I was pretty blah and then very enthused as we learned more and more and more and more about Mr. Riddle as Harry kept sticking his head under water. It was a hate/love relationship for me. I wanted to know about our big bad. I really did. And then I also wanted to just get over all the cleverly-installed flashbacks and get on with the freaking story. \\n That was before the movie. \\n And so the movie came out and I was all like... Where is all the backstory for Voldemort? This is hardly anything! This is just a brief little taste! How are we supposed to feel the deep revulsion AND pity for the man if we can\\'t get more screen time for him??? And so I fell BACK on the bandwagon for all those pretty flashbacks. \\n Ah, the trials and tribulations of a fanboy. \\n This is like knowing Frank Herbert\\'s Dune inside and out and then watching the Lynch mindf*** and spending more than 3/4 of the movie filling in all the details that are left unsaid in the film that make the story deeper and more amazing than the acid trip that I was watching. \\n Okay. Maybe the HP6 film wasn\\'t QUITE that bad and there were a lot of brilliant moments that were visual and direct link-ups to the main plot in the HP7 movies, so continuity was preserved very well. Still, the lack of time with Snape\\'s younger cursecrafting self and the lack of all the mystery subplot with Dumbledore, himself, made the end events kind of rushed and confusing within the movie. \\n Not so at all within the book. \\n The book was a real page-turner for me. Again. I love in-depth reasons. A lot. :) \\n Still a great book! :), Reread January 2017 \\n It\\'s been quite a long time since I\\'ve reread this book and there was so much about it that I had faint remembrance of that when I got to it felt like a breath of fresh air reading. The last time I read this I remember it hadn\\'t been one of my favorites for some reason but now that I\\'m revisiting it after some time I absolutely \\n loved \\n this one! Granted, I love every Harry Potter book but this is the first time I\\'ve read this one in a while and I thoroughly enjoyed it!, THIS BOOK! IS VIOLA AMAZING! One of the series that moved me,hooked me and I SERIOUSLY FELL INLOVE IN HARRY POTTER SERIES, Its Harry Potter. Need I say more? I think not, All of the Harry Potter books are wonderful books to feed your imagination with., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Here\\'s the thing about Harry Potter: They are great stories, and they are carefully organized and thought out. Here\\'s the other thing about Harry Potter: J.K Rowling\\'s writing sucks--in a horrible, Dan Brown kind of way. The first few pages of this book include the idea that a fountain was playing in the distance. Really, Rowling? Other things that bother about Harry Potter: She\\'s too scared to actually kill anyone important. Even Dumbledore dies as if it is his choice. And any other important characters, including Snape, never gain audience sympathy, so their deaths aren\\'t really that important. Which leaves us with the Weasley boy, Tonks, and Lupin. Yes, it is sad when those three die, but they are not Harry, or Ron, or Hermione, or even Malfoy. Epic battles incur epic deaths. And why don\\'t we know more of the backgrounds of death eaters? There are a thousand heroes in this book, but never a thousand bad guys? Finally, as the books dither on, they rely more and more on convenience. Oh, the Sword of Gryffindor showed up? Great, now we can destroy the Horcrux! Oh, we run into a Gringotts ex-bank employee? Great, now we can destroy a horcrux? Oh, no, we\\'re caught stealing from the bank? Great, there\\'s a dragon to save us! The best twists are always surprises. And unfortunately, Rowling\\'s big surprise, Snape, is not really that much of a suprise at all. It\\'s more of a convenience. \\n I think I said this of another book, but the story arch of the Harry Potter series is more IMPRESSIVE than GOOD. I know I\\'m speaking in the minority here, that these books are super popular and beloved, and I probably should have given the book at least one more star, but as these reviews are based on my feelings, I think its moderately better than garbage. No offense. Also, the thing about the Harry Potter series is that the books get harder as they move along, or at least longer. I don\\'t think a child should attempt to tackle this one until around age 12. However the age span for these books seems to be from 9-90., My favorite of the HP Series., Having read this before and having watched the movie twice, I knew what was coming. I can say with great certainty that it did not matter. In fact, the sense of dread building up through the storyline was more intense with this knowledge. \\n This series re-reading is therapeutic, comforting and much needed. Readers\\' advisors in the future are going to point to 2017 as a year of shift in reading/watching habits. Just you wait., Tjis book is now my favorite book in the series. I can\\'t wait to see what happens next., At the end of the book, I just asked myself why... why a book that started with feasts, games, laugs and all that jazz suddenly became a book about deaths, grief, loss.. But all in all, THIS BOOK BLEW MY MIND., Well, I did like Snape after reading this book. I didn\\'t even see it coming that Snape would have history with Harry\\'s mom. Rowling is really a genius. ;), Actual Rating: 4.5 \\n Yeesh. This book was really, really close to not getting 5 stars, and while that sounds fine for any other book, this is Harry Potter we\\'re talking about here. It\\'s not supposed to be close to getting 4 stars. The ending was enough to satisfy me, though, because of... well, you know what. Just because of that, this book managed to sneak past and retain the record. I\\'m not going to let up too easy on the last book, though -- I generally have high expectations of conclusions. \\n I remember from my first read-through of this series that I thought of the two final books as very unsatisfying, compared to the first five. Apparently I still think that, because I had two major issues with this book. One, it was on a bit of a rinse-and-repeat schedule. Everybody knows that\\'s not how Harry Potter goes. It\\'s supposed to be unexpected, and you\\'re not supposed to know what\\'s going to come up next. Two, the characters were starting to grate on my nerves. \\n Like, seriously? Why do Ron and Hermione have to keep shifting back and forth? First they\\'re fine with each other, and then they hate each other so much they make purposeful moves so as not to even look at the other? Then suddenly they\\'re fine again? I get that \"teenage relationships\" go back and forth a lot, but seriously. Ron is so annoying. I\\'m sorry, but he is. I seriously want to punch him in the face. \\n On the other hand, Dumbledore was my favorite character in this book. I\\'m well aware that J.K. Rowling was probably just building up angst because of what happens to him later... but still. He was a well-developed character in this book, and a character that rarely ever irritated me. And for that, I thank him. \\n Also, the book was just so boring. As I previously stated, it was on a rinse-and-repeat schedule. Ron and Hermione either get into a fight or make amends. Things are mentioned about the \"Half-Blood Prince\", or classes. Then there\\'s another lesson with Dumbledore. Then brief things about Voldemort. Sometimes you get the occasional Quidditch. (Speaking of which, we played Quidditch in P.E. Monday. I was so hyped.) Then Ron and Hermione have another intense confrontation/conversation. Things are mentioned once again about the Half-Blood Prince, either that, or it\\'s something about Slughorn. Then we have brief mentions of how hard classes are. And we have another lesson with Dumbledore, which sends Harry into some brief state of euphoria. When I say brief, I mean brief. And then after that, people discuss about Voldemort, or something major centering either Voldemort or the Ministry of Magic is announced. (Yes, I consider Stan Shunpike\\'s arrest \"major\".) It just goes on... and on... and on... \\n But there is a reason why it\\'s rated 5 stars. \\n First of all, it really shows well the time of war going on. It shows how even in wartimes, life continues, and while I haven\\'t really experienced it, I can tell it from this book. There\\'s romance. There\\'s Fred and George\\'s popular wizard jokes shop, which is getting many customers even though the most powerful Dark wizard of all time is back. Alas, I still wish that we discussed more about the Order of the Phoenix (I mean, come on, last book was named after them), but I guess you can\\'t have everything. Too bad some of my favorite characters are in the Order of the Phoenix... \\n Also, I found the ending incredible. I powered right through the ending, and it was so wonderfully written in a way that tugged at your heartstrings. \\n Pretty decent book, I suppose. However, there\\'s a bit of a sour taste in my mouth from it, and I really only gave it 5 stars due to my reverie of the previous books., Another great story, I just enjoyed to be part of the story. Because somehow I was a part of the story, believe or not I was. In this story I had chance to view Tom Riddle (As a child (Baltimore as known)), that was one wonderful point, in other view I had chance to view how Albus Dumbledor, dies because he was killed by Snapes. Who joined the dark powers, I also saw how the good people join the dark powers, only because they get something which is the best which can make them the best! \\n Also a new teacher come along, also I had a chance to see the magic teleport, sometimes this teleport freaks me out. But this is something else, out of the topic if I can say this. I\\'m now watching the 7 part, 6 part every single minute we see more and more awesome stuff happening! \\n However this happens and in 7 part. Just a great work, it was like I was part of the world!, I haven\\'t really been writing reviews of the Harry Potter books this time through, but I have to say, I think Half-Blood Prince might be my favorite of the last three books--possibly because it\\'s slightly shorter than the other two. I like the trips into the Pensieve to explore Voldemort\\'s backstory, the fact that even though most of the wizarding world now believes Harry and Dumbledore, the Ministry doesn\\'t stop being a bureaucratic pain in the butt, the introduction of Slughorn (continuing to prove, along with Dolores Umbridge, that the world isn\\'t divided into good people and Death Eaters)...I like that even though we\\'re hurtling towards the final installment at breakneck speed, there is still room for teenagers acting like teenagers. There is a lot of romance (and snogging) in this book, from Bill and Fleur, to Harry and Ginny, to Ron and Hermione starting to figure it out, to Tonks and Lupin (about whom I will be reading some fanfiction in the near future...yep, I\\'m almost 30 years old). It\\'s great. Giving myself a short break before I start Deathly Hallows., This is the 6th out of 7 volumes and the magic isn\\'t fading - how could it - I mean, it is Harry Potter. Seriously!, Hands down the best book in the series I\\'ve read so far. Even having seen the movies first (I know...bad me...) the last 200 pages of this were absolutely amazing. Rowling is a true wizard when it comes to words., The begining is boring., Great. Excellent. Amazing. Such a worthwhile read. I can\\'t believe it\\'s taken me this long to finish it, but it was an amazing journey. \\n You\\'ve seen the movie, but the book does it so much better. You owe it to your self to have read this. \\n 10/10, So many feelings., I think the first time I read this one it was somewhat marred by everyone constantly telling me the humongous spoiler for the ending. This time, however, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it, just because I haven\\'t ever considered the sixth one a particular favorite (that spot is reserved for PoA and GoF). I may have to add it to that list, however, as I especially enjoyed it this time. Or I should just accept that I can never truly rank these books because I love them so much (except the second, which will always be my least favorite)., Hazar angam filmere ditel ow heto kardal ow bats`ahaytels, t`e inch`k`an aveli em sirowm Dumbledore-i kerpare, miazhamanak inch`k`an em hianowm Voldemort-inov, nshanakowm a, Rowling-i karhowts`ats ashkharhi het gortsers derh avartvats ch`en: Rowling-i lezown artakarg siown a, nakhshown barher ow nkaragrowt`yownner a talis: (otherworldly music/ stricken lament of terrible beauty) \\n Luna-n ir unconfortable truth-erov... \\n Isk Harry-i masin kasem, or hents` kardalis zgats`i, or nman a shat Bilbo Baggins-in , verjowm datarkowt`yownits` kam ksksi girk` grel kam zzvats`nel erekhek`in ir zhamanaki patmowt`yownnerov inch`-or Voldemort-neri, arhak`ini kakhardneri ow siro masin... kam el kgtni nor paterazmner, onts` arets` Watson-e Afghanstani arkatsnerits` heto: \\n Anyway, ch`kharhnvem J.K.

Narcissa and Snape are the reasons why I rate the book so highly. I definitely appreciate Narcissa more now in hindsight, as well as Draco., \"It is unknown that we fear when we look upon darkness and death. Nothing more.\" \\n This is the best Harry Potter sequel I\\'ve ever read. Heart aching yet brightening. Sad and twisted. \\n I\\'m not sure about the others but Dumbeldore is my icon. Thanks Rowling and the character you created. Dumbeldore has brightened my life. \\n The imaginary character that I will always look upon., ah, the cover... \\n pensieve., Once again - so sad, yet so brilliant. The pacing was perfect, the plot was great, the characters are all amazing in their own way (aside, obviously, from Umbridge, even though she only appeared in about two sentences in this book), and J.K. Rowling is a genius. That is really all I have to say right now. \\n I\\'m a little scared to start the final book, knowing what will come; but at the same time, I can\\'t wait to go on. I\\'m a little torn. (Knowing myself, I\\'ll be starting the next book tonight, anyway, or tomorrow at the earliest.), FINALLY!, and so...dumbledore dies. and snape is branded as a traitor. \\n my favorite book by far. i dont know why exactly, but this one is definitely my favorite., Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy... This is the Harry Potter book I\\'ve been waiting for. For me, this book never stalled. I was constantly engrossed in the material, even when there were trivial mishaps and fights. This book also added something that was missing in the others; the gradual introduction of romance. It\\'s been hanging obviously in between the lines of the 4th and 5th books but it finally came to be in this one. I\\'m a sucker for romance and especially when it isn\\'t over the top cheesy. As you read, you can also tell that everyone is maturing which is refreshing and without it this book would have been intolerable. All in all, this book was a joy to read with the added YA element to an already magical telling. \\n Also, TOM RIDDLE\\'S BACKSTORY???? Finally you get to reason, not an excuse, to why he is the way he is. How his mannerisms make it clear that he would rather fly solo and how he made Harry his weakness. Brilliantly done. \\n Peace out, Dumbledore. You are missed., I believe that it is absolutely pointless to review a Harry Potter book, but this is my favourite so far. Just saying., Merlin\\'s beard.... this book is definitely... \\n Now I know why so many people say that J.K. Rowling is a living legend. She really knows her stuff., Warning: Spoilers are present in this review \\n It was easier for me to immediately get into the central story in this one, mainly because Harry has stopped being as moody as he was in the Order of Phoenix, and that in itself made me like the sixth installment in this series more. I think that The Half Blood Prince might be my favorite one so far (just behind it is The Prisoner of Azkaban). I can\\'t really say why, but there was something that kept me so immersed in it that I had to stay up late to finish. That\\'s not to say that the others don\\'t possess the same quality - but even so, I felt it more here. It could just be the fact that I enjoyed the subplots more.Normally I don\\'t like it when there\\'s a lot of memories and flashbacks in a book, but J.K. Rowling unfolds everything so skillfully as always, and learning about Voldemort\\'s past was quite interesting to me. I suppose he had a bad childhood, so that could have contributed to his evilness, but overall I think he\\'s just crazy. It also answered something that had been puzzling me since the beginning of the Goblet of Fire - I didn\\'t get how three Riddles were murdered in their big house. But with the explanation midway into the novel it all made sense. I\\'ve learned to just go with the flo when it comes to the Harry Potter books, knowing that eventually I\\'ll have no more questions to ask. \\n I always felt like Harry was right to keep such a close eye on Draco throughout his sixth year at Hogwarts, especially after everything he heard on the train. I found it a little odd that Ron and Hermione dismissed Harry\\'s serious suspicions about Draco so easily with the evidence that steadily kept piling up. I was surprised at the turn his character took, honestly. He\\'s always been a pest, yes, and definitely a worthy enemy of Harry\\'s, ever since the first book. Still, I was sad when he started working with the Death Eaters, and by the end of HP number six, I felt really bad for him. He probably felt like he had no choice, what with his whole family being on Voldemort\\'s side. That doesn\\'t excuse his actions, though. I\\'m curious to see what will become of him in the last one. \\n I can honestly say that the HP books have the best secondary characters of any series I\\'ve ever read (and that\\'s quite a statement, coming from me. I like to think I\\'ve read a lot.) Almost all of them have made some kind of impression on me, whether they were good or bad. For example, I kind of love Luna, even though she hasn\\'t been around a whole lot, and was just introduced in the last book. She may be a little odd, but she has this open way of stating things; I\\'m really hoping for some kind of happy ending for her. All the Weasleys will always have a special place in my heart. I was, however, kind of surprised by Harry\\'s feelings for Ginny. They seemed to spring up very suddenly. I mean, they\\'ve known each other for over five years and he just now realizes that she\\'s pretty and awesome. I got used to it after a while, but I kind of wish the relationship had a little more development. I was really disappointed at first because Ginny was really quiet, and as close to a flat character as you can get in the HP books. \\n But she actually showed some personality here, much more fiery than before. I was annoyed when Harry broke up with her at the end. It was obvious that Voldemort would use whoever Harry cared about against him, but he could just as easily use Ron or Hermione, and I didn\\'t see him ditching them. In both the books and the movies, I have seen tiny hints of feelings between Ron and Hermione. I think that they came out a lot more in this one. It was obvious after Hermione\\'s temper tantrum with the birds when Ron got together with Lavender (who was extremely annoying). On one hand I felt kind of bad for the both of them, but on the other I\\'ve gotten to the point where I\\'m just really frustrated with their dance-around-the-feelings thing. I think they\\'re pretty cute together, though I do wonder sometimes what made Rowling decide not to put two of her main characters together. \\n The most heart-stopping, punch in the gut was definitely the end when Dumbledore died. I had some suspicion of it happening based off some comments I\\'d read in some reviews, but I was hoping against hope I was wrong and it wouldn\\'t happen. I had come to care for him so much as a character in this series that I was simply devastated upon reading about his demise. I actually had to put the book aside for a few minutes so I could cry about it; he was so wise and friendly, yet so powerful. I didn\\'t expect Draco to be the one to kill him in the tower based on the way he was already acting (he was crying earlier in the bathroom, after all), but I also didn\\'t think Snape would be the one to do it. Obviously I\\'ve always disliked him for his behavior towards Harry, but I was hoping he had really changed (though maybe some part of me thought he didn\\'t, even though five years had gone by without him murdering Harry). And the fact that Snape was the Half Blood Prince? I probably should have seen that coming, what with all the advice he gave coming out of a Potions book, but I really didn\\'t. I still don\\'t feel like I completely understand Snape\\'s character, but as of now I hate him for killing Dumbledore. This book was an excellent set-up for the final chapter, and though I want to put off reading it because it\\'s the last one, I know I won\\'t because I just have to see how this all ends immediately., 4.5 \\n I was just really annoyed with Dumbledore in this one, 5*, I really think Harry Potter just gets better and better as the books progress, and more serious too. Now that Voldemort\\'s comeback is out in the open and Harry is aware of the role he has to play, the sixth book chronicle\\'s Harry\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts, in which he learns a great deal about Voldemort\\'s past through lessons with Dumbledore and also finds some surprising lessons in the writing left in his Potions textbook. All of which leads up to a conclusion that reveals as much as it leaves questions unanswered., WOW just WOW, last read 9/19/11, Oh my gosh so many damn emotions this book. \\n - We learn how and why Voldemort has been capable of living after going through so much. Horcruxs which contain small fragments of Voldemorts soul in each of them. We must destroy all the Horcruxs in order to destroy Voldemort! \\n - The battle at Hogwarts...SO MANY FEELS. At first Dumbledore being brutally murdered by freaking SNAPE. Never should\\'ve trusted that many. Only for Hagrids hut to catch on fire and for Fang to nearly die! Such an intense scene. \\n - Fleur and Bills love after the accident. The way the Weasleys finally realized that Fleur is more than just her appearance and that her love for Bill runs deep. \\n They\\'re no longer teenagers dealing with mundane things. Voldemort is growing stronger as well as his following of death eaters. The books are taking a darker turn as the end is nearing. The students are all growing older and taking on more serious aspects of life., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I don\\'t know why I gave it 5 stars in the first reading; this is my least favorite of the entire series. Dumbledore, my favorite character (besides Harry) gets murdered while Harry watches it happen. \\n The first time I cried a river. I thought the second time would be different and it was but only slightly. I still cried though, which surprised me because of the reason behind it, which had nothing to do with Dumbledore. \\n I watched while someone in my family was murdered, although not the same way Harry did. Harry actually saw Dumbledore\\'s body die. \\n We never saw the body of our relative, but we watched as Tower 1 crashed to the ground knowing he was trapped inside and could do nothing to save himself. I\\'ve never been able to describe with words what that did to me to see it occur. I\\'m supposed to have 7 transferrable college credits in creative writing but some events defy explanation through the use of mere words. I can\\'t find the right combination to describe exactly what that did to me to be forced to watch as someone in my family lost his life to the beast that is Hatred. \\n At any rate Book 6 of Harry Potter is my least favorite in the series. Although it was written almost flawlessly. I\\'m terminally impressed by the author\\'s cleverness. She\\'s way more clever than almost every male author but I believe she has yet to be given proper credit for her abilities., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Omg that am was so sad !! I cried when Dumbledore died :\\'( .. Amazing book .. Starting the next one right away !, *sobs uncontrollably* \\n Why yes it was a great book., This is probably the best and most frustrating entry in the series. The romance here is getting real, and despite J.K. being kinda weird with it, it\\'s described so well. Even this weirdness is absolutely believable, considering it\\'s a book about 16 years old people. What I loved the first time and totally adored this time is that there\\'s a lot of mystery in #6, that doesn\\'t lift until late into #7. \\n It can be a bit frustrating to go through all of Dumbledore\\'s actions without any knowledge of why he\\'s doing what he\\'s doing, but I like it. Mostly because you have to trust J.K. that it has a point, it\\'s not worthless, and that you\\'ll get the explanation you seek and actually need right now. This one is also the best evidence that Harry Potter isn\\'t just a bunch of books, but a well-thought series that has its amazing logic. \\n Reading it about a decade after the first time, I really appreciate how much I love the whole series, but this entry especially. Thanks, J.K.!, it was really good... \\n R.I.P Albus Dumbledore!!!!, bestill my ever-beating heart \\n WHY DOES THIS BOOK MAKE ME CRY SO MUCH, Re-read this with my youngest son and we enjoyed all the discrepancies with the movie. I\\'m enjoyed this more the second time round. I found it a little long the first time, though better than the Goblet. \\n Favorite quote so far. \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\", The first time I read this book, I really didn\\'t like it that much. But ironically when I watched all the movies, this one was my favorite. So I think knowing that I enjoyed this movie the most, I actually ended up enjoying this book a lot more. Reading Dumbledore\\'s death still made me super sad, but it was easier to get through this time around. I just remember being really shocked by it the first time. Being prepared really helped soften the blow from his death. I\"m glad I finally got around to reading this again so I can give it the appreciation it actually deserves., I really liked this book.I was surprised when I understand that halfblood prince was snape. dambldore was very kind and powerful whitch and I was really sad about his death., Something about a ring . . . I don\\'t know., Novel ini merupakan novel ke-6 dari sekuel Harry Potter. Novelnya lumayan tebal yakni lebih dari 800 halaman, namun saya suka dengan covernya dimana terdapat gambar Harry bersama Dumbledore. Novel ini banyak membahas tentang \"Pangeran berdarah campuran\". Menceritakan tentang kembalinya pangeran kegelapan Voldemort bersama para pengikutnya yang terkenal dengan julukan \"Pelahap Maut\". Mereka melakukan serangan, pembunuhan, dan penghancuran dimana-mana. Dalam novel ini, Albus Dumbledore terbunuh oleh Severus Snape dengan mantra kutukan \"Avada Kedavra\"., This was my first, but definitely not my last, time reading this book. I love the whole series and wish there were more still to come. (review written 2010), Ok - hated teh movie, a utter wreck. \\n But i love all the books but this one is tedious, it\\'s been a while since i read it....hmmmmm :S, OMG, the ending always makes me cry! :\\'(, My favorite of the series, I finished listening to this as a refresh before the movie comes out., This is my absolute favorite of the HP books., Okay so like many of you I was exposed to the word going around town, the internet and most likely the world, that Dumbledore dies at the end of this book and that it is Snape that kills him. So as I read this it wasn\\'t like reading the others, there was no joy in it. Now don\\'t take that wrong, I loved the book, but knowing what was going to happen, just killed it. Still love Harry Potter., I don\\'t remember ever crying so much over a book. \\n Today I had a free afternoon, and I spent it reading the last 200 pages, not being able to put it down. I knew exactly what was going to happen, but I couldn\\'t help myself stop wasting so much tears on my books (and, despite the fact that I can cry all of my tears on a film or even a TV spot, I am not one that cry so much while reading). \\n I read this books \"only\" twice, but this second reading has been a little shock, even though I perfectly knew what the story would tell. \\n I know this is not the best thing literature can offer me, I perfectly know that this saga is nothing special compared to masterpiece of the literature world, but everything that can move so much someone has some value, and I know re-reding those books can\\'t be a waste of time., Too many feels rn! \\n Here are my favorite and oh so shocking moments from this book: http://youtu.be/MIBYe7oqgi8?a \\n Check it out, I read the entire collection every year for my sanity. I don\\'t expect you to understand., Could not put this down and a great improvement from length of the 5th novel in the series. Much less going on and much more to the point. #3 is still my favourite book but this would be a close second! Dark, witty and fairly fast paced, your left with thrills and hangers but they are resolved within a reasonable amount of time. The dashes of romance and humour add to a very gritty addition to the series. I cant wait to finish the final book., I\\'m not ashamed to admit that I cried through the whole last chapter of this book. Not only is it sad, but also I realized how close I am to being done with that series. I almost don\\'t want to read the Deathly Hallows because then it will all be over (besides the Cursed Child). And I don\\'t want it be over. It\\'s to good to be over., Very good suspense!, I fucking LOVED THIS ONE. \\n The movie is actually a massive disappointment now that I think about it., Great, great, great! Way to make me cry, Rowling!, 4.5/5 actually!!, NOT ready for this reread to be over. I\\'m not sure when I\\'ll get to the 7th book but dammit these books are just as fantastic years later. (Duh.) \\n Current favorites in order: 4,3,1,6,5,2 \\n (I have a feeling 7 will fall towards the middle - I remember being bored during all the walking but the middle/end GAH), Loved it. Couldn\\'t put it down., Oh, Dumbledore. I didn\\'t cry, though, I swear., It\\'s Harry, what can I say except-where\\'s the next book?, The great thing about rereading is that you visit a time in your life when you thought differently. For a long time I thought that Half-Blood Prince was my favorite of the Harry Potter books and now, 10 years later, as I read this one I loved it. I really really loved it, it\\'s a 5 star read but now I\\'m not sure if I can still call this my favorite of the Harry Potter books. I almost love The Order of the Phoenix more which is hilarious to me especially since for a long time OOtP was my least favorite of the books. It just shows you how we change. \\n I had forgotten about 60% of what happens in this book so I have decided that I need to read the Harry Potter books every 3-4 years. I still laugh at the jokes and everything felt fresh and modern, these books have aged to incredibly well. I also have to commend Rowling for her \\'growing up\\' of Harry in this book as this is the book when Harry faces down the Minister of Magic all by himself with plenty of sass to go around. I had also forgotten just how awesome Ginny is, when Ginny came to the forefront of the books she was met with a lot of backlash - she was a sharp contrast to beloved Hermione which I felt was incredibly unfair to her since Rowling had YEARS to flesh out Hermione and since the books are told in Harry\\'s POV he just doesn\\'t notice Ginny until this book so we notice her as Harry notices her. The Mary-Sue term was stamped on her something fierce (a term I find both insulting and sexist). Rowling has such an uncanny ability to write female characters, even if all they get is a few lines, Tonks, Luna, Fleur and Mrs. Malfoy are a few that come to mind. \\n I\\'m a little sad that I\\'m coming to the end of the books, I\\'ve enjoyed the reread so much and in these crazy political times they have been my happy place which I am incredibly grateful for., I noticed that Ron says \"Hell\" in this book. That\\'s one sign of its upped mature content. I can\\'t imagine what it must have felt like as a young person to read this long before the movie came out and get hit by the ending of Dumbledore dying. The scene that brought a lump to my throat, though, was the one where Harry must make Dumbledore keep drinking that poisoned potion obscuring the locket. In that scene it\\'s clear how much Harry has grown, and that he\\'s willing to shoulder bigger burdens. \\n The scenes with the pensieve, of course, are fascinating - those glimpses of Tom Riddle as a young man, growing into his evil. The concept of horcruxes is fascinating as well. And finally, the glimpses of Snape\\'s struggle, which of course Harry doesn\\'t see. \\n Rowling has really set up the final volume well., I may have cried just a little at the ending of this one. I have seen the movies but the books really hit closer to home. I loved the Half Blood Prince so much and I do think it may have been my favourite out of the whole series. \\n J.K Rowling once again, your writing is superb. How did I not read these books sooner?, AMAZING!! Escuse me while I start rereading the fabulous DH., Even though I knew what was coming, I cried straight through the end of Half-Blood Prince. J.K Rowling has done an incredible job with this series. She weaves in elements and moments from previous books in amazing ways. I loved SPOILER!!!!! \\n Harry and Ginny FINALLY happening!!!! \\n I have no idea what i feel about Snape. \\n I finally know what the Horcruxes are and what they do. \\n It was really interesting to find out about Voldemort\\'s past and how he became more and more evil. \\n I did not expect Snape to be the Half-Blood Prince at all Ii definitely thought that it was Voldemort back in the day. \\n END SPOILER! \\n I can\\'t believe that there is only one book left in the Harry Potter series. I can\\'t wait to read it however at the same time I don\\'t want it to end!, Fav line: \"I am good looking enough for both of us\", Nossa, amei esse livro ainda mais do que amei nas primeiras vezes que li. Nao lembrava de tanta coisa! E um dos livros que tem menos acao e ainda assim sempre fico muita presa ao livro, principalmente pelo passado do Voldemort. Poucos autores conseguem construir viloes tao bem quanto a J.K. E ate os momentos romanticos do livro sao otimos. A Gina e o Harry no livro sao tao fofos e toda vez que lembro como o desenvolvimento deles no filme foi ridiculo, fico irritadissima, mas bem, e isso ai, permanece meu livro favorito da serie. Vamos ver se depois de reler reliquias da morte (meu segundo favorito) vou mudar de opiniao., As I re-read the Harry Potter series for my Mythgard class, \"Taking Harry Seriously,\" reading The Half-Blood Prince is particularly bittersweet. (NOTE: I don\\'t think there are major spoilers in the following discussion, but if you\\'re extremely sensitive to being spoiled, play it safe and don\\'t read further.) \\n This one has so many \"lasts.\" Last time the kids get to be just kids, just Hogwarts students. Last time to worry about getting a girlfriend or passing an exam or winning a Quidditch match before the life, death, and soul struggles of The Deathly Hallows. One of my favorites in this vein: the kids learning to Apparate and struggling to get their Apparition licenses, similar to the way we Muggle kids had to pass our driving tests. Only we worried about getting into fender-benders during driver training, whereas they have to worry about getting splinched and leaving parts of their bodies behind! It\\'s this kind of detail of everyday life in the Wizarding World that makes the books such treasures, so much richer than the movies (which I do enjoy, also). \\n It\\'s also interesting to me how this book is connected to Book 2, Chamber of Secrets. So many things that were introduced in Chamber of Secrets (and possibly not mentioned since) become important again in Half-Blood Prince: several items that were casually seen in Borgin and Burkes when Harry ended up there by accident; Dobby the House Elf; Tom Riddle\\'s Diary; Aragog the giant spider--and probably a host of other things I\\'m not remembering at the moment. This is another reason the books are so powerful to me--Rowling obviously had such a detailed plan in her head from the beginning that this book series reads, to me, like one cohesive story. NOT a series of Harry Potter adventures she threw together after the success of the first book. \\n A co-worker recently asked that common question--if you had to choose one book to take with you if you were stranded on a desert island, which one would you take. Before I could speak (because she knows me well), she said, \"You have to choose ONE Harry Potter book.\" This is absurdly unfair to me, because that\\'s like telling me I could only take a few chapters of some other book!, Oh...my...lord, I knew what was coming. I knew what would happen. But I still cried. I insanely cried while I was in the bus travelling home. And I didn\\'t care. \\n BRB, STILL CRYING., Amazing. Loved the close relationship between Harry and Dumbledore. Heartbreaking ending!!, All Harry Potter books are bae. \\n The ending hasn\\'t changed, because, Part of my Great Potter Re-Listen of 2010, since I\\'ve read all the books in print and on cd but have never listened to the cds. To me, HBP is an odd book, the closest Rowling comes to \"info-dumping\" on us. Part of me wonders if some of the things revealed herein might not have been better revealed a bit earlier in the series, but the logical side of me doesn\\'t see how Rowling could have done that. So while the book slows down a little bit in the various Pensieve scenes, that slow-down is a necessary side-effect of what is great about these books: that we get 95% of the story from Harry\\'s perspective and only learn things when he does. There are tons of great moments, of course, all leading up to the death of Albus Dumbledore. From Harry and Dumbledore\\'s arrival at the cave to the book\\'s final fight, there is a headlong momentum that is virtually unstoppable., WHY DUMBLEDORE???? WHY??!?!, Best one yet., Without a doubt my favourite book ever. It\\'s so cleverly put together, gripping and magical, J.K. Rowling continues to lead her readers on an ever-darkening and ominous path toward the fate of Harry Potter, Lord Voldemort, the wizarding world and the oblivious muggles as well. Books five and six have both been much more dark than the first four. Harry Potter followers have watched the maturing young man rise from the ashes time and again, like his friend, Fawkes the Phoenix. Book six leaves him preparing for his biggest challenge yet and readers anxious to delve into the answers they know must await them in book seven. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince shows an ever-growing maturity in the title character; a maturity which, quite clearly, is preparing him for his destiny., It all gets so sad and serious. *sobs*, This book was awesome. I can\\'t believe all that is happening. I still see Harry, Hermione and Ron as 11 year olds but they aren\\'t and I\\'m dying to read the next book. I like how this series has gone from feeling like a simple story to being so involved and darker. You have to know it will become dark because of the premise of the story. I really love this telling of the classic good vs. evil., At least in this book SOME good things happen - like him taking the luck potion and learning new spells etc. etc. and we get to see more of the main villain\\'s past - there\\'s a darker psychological aspect too. JK was a lot more creative here - which reminded me a lot of book 3 (my favorite). The best part of book 6 is the cave scenario with all of the zombies in the black lake - I mean c\\'mon - the book has zombies, curses that split the enemies body in half, and jewelry, and Harry gets two professors really drunk (black out drunk!) - so clever is our little grasshopper! \\n In book 5 we see Harry being immature and he doesn\\'t like to listen to anyone. He kind of annoying with his hormonal teen angst issues. In book 6 we see that Harry is the mature one and no one listens to him (except for his friend Ron), including Dumbledore who ends up getting killed because of it. . . and I didn\\'t cry - yeah, it\\'s sad that an old wise moral wizard died and Harry is alone now, but if anything he really let Harry down and he should\\'ve just killed Snape when he had a chance and then bring out the big guns with the main villian - none of this peace treaty nonsene!, My favorite!, Here\\'s the thing about the Harry Potter books... \\n They\\'re awesome. \\n Deep, huh? Well, deep or shallow, it\\'s the truth. I waited a long time to read the Harry Potter books because I wanted to experience them with my own children. My son (8) and I just finished the sixth book, my first daughter (6) and I are working on the first, and my youngest child (3) is content to commandeer her siblings\\' wands and run around shrieking, \"I have a Harry Potter stick!\" \\n In other words, we all enjoy it. \\n I could write a great deal about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, but it\\'s a tough book to write about without giving things away. And though I loved this novel for many reasons, I find it quite difficult to separate it from the other tales. This, I think, speaks to J.K. Rowling\\'s ability to connect the stories in a such a way that they each have their own identity while still continuing to trace a gigantic glowing arc through the sky along which the reader is able to ride from the first book to the seventh. \\n So before I tell you a few things I loved about the novel, please know that there might be spoilers below. Not huge spoilers, mind you, but I\\'m always afraid of letting something slip. So...be forewarned. Don\\'t read on if you haven\\'t read this book yet. And if you haven\\'t read the book, why are you reading a review of it by a writer whose skills don\\'t yet approach J.K. Rowling\\'s? Seriously. Get off the danged Internet and read this amazing series! \\n Some delights and terrors and sorrows... \\n 1. Fenrir Greyback: Bet that surprised you a little. I know that this character played a relatively minor role, but on the page he was a scene-stealer, a flesh-chewer, and a perfect foil for one of my favorite character, Remus Lupin. \\n An aside: About a year before I began reading the series, my Creative Writing class was discussing characterization. The kids began talking about the Harry Potter books. One remarked that the supporting characters were as interesting as the leads, which led another student to bring up Remus Lupin. She was halfway through her cataloging of his merits as a character when she stopped and looked up at me, as if seeing me anew. She then said, \"Mr. (Insert real name here). You sort of remind me of Lupin.\" When I later found out he was a werewolf, I was a little bit shocked (and secretly pleased). But when I really got to know the character, I found the remark incredibly gratifying. \\n Back to Fenrir Greyback (with whom I hope I have nothing in common)... \\n What made Greyback so incredibly interesting to me was not only the sheer ferocity of his behavior, but the diabolical simplicity of his motives. If the Harry Potter books were likened to Lord of the Flies and Voldemort\\'s ambition were compared with Jack\\'s (the leader of the hunters), then Greyback would be Roger, the sadist. This powderkeg of a character lives only to rend flesh and to guzzle the steaming lifeblood of his victims. Greyback doesn\\'t want to rule the world; he simply wants to terrorize it. I don\\'t know what kind of a role he plays in the seventh book (if any), but his unreasoning brutality added just the right note of menace to a book that largely---and sensitively---focused on the romantic relationships of its teenagers. \\n 2. Fleur\\'s Surprising Reaction: I admit to falling prey to a stupid prejudice here, and I feel awful about it. But I wrongly assumed Fleur Delacour was a pretty face without a soul. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire she was the object of many male desires (Ron\\'s particularly), and though she was skilled at wizardry, she wasn\\'t an especially affecting character. She did seem affected, however, and when she showed up again in Book Six, I, like Mrs. Weasley, rolled my eyes and dismissed her as a fluttery, vapid future supermodel. \\n How wrong I was. \\n One mark of a great writer, I think, is the ability to surprise the reader without cheating. That\\'s J.K. Rowling. When something terrible befell Fleur\\'s fiance, I was all set to mentally berate her for her superficiality. But rather than making a caricature out of Fleur---as I fear I unknowingly did---Rowling transformed her and made her deeply endearing with a couple elegant lines of dialogue. \\n And I loved that. So here\\'s to continual reminders to not judge people by appearances or even their seeming personalities. People can still surprise us, and we need to give them the opportunity to do so. \\n *takes a deep breath* \\n And lastly... \\n 3. Dumbledore: If you\\'ve read this far, you\\'ve only been assailed by minor spoilers. I don\\'t want to spoil this plot twist, but I don\\'t know how to talk about it without spoiling it. And the fact is, I don\\'t want to talk about it. \\n Rarely has a fictional character so resonated with me the way Albus Dumbledore has. In the first book he was wise, eccentric, and a constant source of comfort. As the series has developed, he has persisted in exhibiting those traits, but he has also grown more than most might think. He has revealed a penchant for trusting others too much. He has admitted how fallible he is, how prone to mistakes. He has been injured, accused of wrongdoing, and generally fed through a physical and emotional woodchipper. \\n And he has come through it all with an open, caring heart and an enormous capacity for love. One passage in particular, I think, summarizes this amazing character for me. In a scene that chronicles how Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore attempts to gird Harry\\'s resolve and confidence in the inevitable battle with his nemesis: \\n \"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can---\" \\n \"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficult that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\" \\n \"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\" \\n \"So, when the prophecy says that I\\'ll have \\'power the Dark Lord knows not,\\' it just means---love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down. \\n \"Yes---just love,\" said Dumbledore. \\n The above passage will strike some as too direct, too naive, or worst of all, too emotional. \\n It struck me as incredibly beautiful. There are all sorts of belief systems in the world, and no two people are exactly alike in their beliefs. But what Dumbledore says here is something that, were it adopted by more people, would alter our world for the better. Harry, for all his flaws, usually acts with good intentions. He befriends Luna Lovegood (another one of my favorite characters in all of fiction), gives of himself to others, and is willing to suffer so that others won\\'t have to experience the same pain. In other words, Harry loves. \\n And so can Dumbledore. Which is why this book was so memorable, wonderful, and painful to me. \\n I\\'m going to go now. My wife is making a delicious supper. My son and first daughter are ready to wrestle. And my three-year-old is racing around the house casting spells on the furniture with her Harry Potter stick. \\n And for that, J.K. Rowling, I thank you., !NO SE QUE PENSAR! !NO SE QUE PENSAR! \\n Admito que en un principio el libro estaba bastante lento y me desesperaba el hecho de que me dieran y me dieran datos pero nunca respuestas concretas pero una vez el libro se desarrollo yo empece a sufrir... \\n Me ha fascinado la madurez que ha presentado cada uno de los personajes, sobre todo Harry que ya no es el nino que pensaba que solo el podia hacer las cosas bien, ni tampoco una persona acelerada que actuaba por instinto cuando era requerido detenerse a reflexionar, eso en parte se debe a sus perdidas. \\n El final es una cosa que jamas en la vida me espere, aun no me puedo creer que se haya presentado una situacion de este nivel y me sorprende muchisimo que las personas involucradas sean las involucradas, no se que pensar. \\n En un momento llegue a odiar el libro pero era por la introduccion tan lenta que se le dio, pero sin duda, cuando los problemas dieron inicio, se convirtio en mi segundo libro favorito de esta saga (falta ver que pasa en Las Reliquias de la Muerte) y es que no podemos negar que en esas partes la autora se queda corta en cuanto a ritmo y eso causa un aburrimiento fatidico que obviamente repara con el desenlace de la historia. \\n El amor que se ha desatado en las paginas me ha parecido tan tierno... De esos amores tan inocentes... Tan puros que me han sacado mas de una sonrisa. \\n El libro posee muchisima informacion crucial, que si bien me deja claro los porques de los libros anteriores, me deja tambien con muchisimas dudas mas que espero me resuelven en el gran final de esta maravillosa y magica historia. Creo que todavia hay mucha tela para cortar y en eso acierta la autora, en saber manejar la historia sin depurar absolutamente nada, lastima que de paso muchas veces al aburrimiento pero ya hemos hablamos de eso. \\n Quedo fascinado con este libro por el gran final que presento, no les puedo negar que sufri a mares y que jamas en la vida olvidare todo lo que sucedio y JAMAS EN LA VIDA PERDONARE A LAS PERSONAS INVOLUCRADAS, NO ME IMPORTA LAS RAZONES QUE TUVIERON, SIEMPRE PODEMOS ELEGIR Y ELLOS ELIGIERON, QUE SE PUDRAN., Re read from 12 years ago. Fav one out of the entire series, Reread, all of the Harry Potter books are banned and/or burned in self-righteous fires. All are made of gold, and most that ban or burn them have not even attempted to read them. \\n This particular book is my 3rd favorite in the series. \\n Reasons for the insane banning of this and other HP books: \\n \"tells kids that lying, cheating, and stealing are cute and acceptable; a masterpiece of Satanic deception; witchcraft; deals with ghosts, cults, and witchcraft; stupid; portrays good witches and good magic; stories about magic and wizards could draw students into Satanism; homosexuality; profanity; anti-Christian; a filthy, filthy book; have a serious tone of death, hate, lack of respect, and sheer evil; contain lying and smart-aleck retorts to adults\", My second favourite form the saga. We can appreciate a really grown up Harry...He has embraced his destiny and has sterted to live along that destiny. But some things like love usually come without being called. The end of the story begins now..., Harry is some how passing his potions class and no one knows how, well his friends do, but who is this half blood prince. Malfoy is up to something and it ain\\'t good, Snape has taken an oath to make sure he is looked after. Then Harry and Dumbledore go off to find an object having to do with Voldemort. When they come back Malfoy was to kill the headmaster but Snape does instead, you come to find out Snape is the half blood prince. \\n I guess i kind of just told the story but it was so great, one of my favorite in the series. A must read., AWESOME, OMG!, Crying over Dumbledore all over again...geez..., Noooo! I\\'m so sad this book is over. This was by far the most emotional Harry Potter book so far, in my opinion. All the bickering, love, tragedy, humor, anger and excitement! I\\'m looking forward to reading the last book of this series but I\\'m also contemplating waiting to read it for a few weeks.. Just so it won\\'t be over so soon! \\n Even though I grew up with the movies, I never managed to read the books until this year. When I was younger reading just wasn\\'t particularly interesting to me. And even when I started to develop an interest for books when I was around 13/14 I never really cared about Harry Potter. But now everything has changed and I am obsessed and oddly enough I\\'m already bummed out about finishing Harry Potter because I don\\'t want it to end., Thus far, The Half-Blood Prince is my favorite volume of the Harry Potter series. This book is easily in my top 5 reads of 2016. \\n Justin., This book was so good! Definitely the hardest to get through in the series though. So much sadness! But the last book is totally worth it. LOVE the writing style and all of the decisions she made, even though some of them hurt., A beautiful book with an end that made me cry!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n Okay, okay, okay, let me get my thoughts together. \\n First off, I have never cried so much because of a book. I was able to prevent myself from crying up until the funeral. I knew Dumbledore had died in this book but I was denying that it would happen. I just... people can still like Snape? I know in Deathly Hallows, Snape will probably say, \"I had to convince the Death Eaters that I was on their side, Dumbledore would\\'ve proudly died for this cause!\" I\\'m still in half-denial. \\n On a lighter note, I have so many questions. First and foremost, I have been spoiled that Harry is a Horcrux, and I know the answer will be in Deathly Hallows, but... how? Won\\'t he have to destroy himself? Plus, who the heck is the person who has the locket? (I was so anxious throughout that scene; I felt that Dumbledore would die because there weren\\'t enough pages left in the book for it to be otherwise.) \\n Side note: I volunteer to throw Draco Malfoy into the sun (and no, I would not like \"redeeming\" things to happen in Deathly Hallows. I don\\'t care if he fights against Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts.) \\n I\\'m just now realizing how spoiled I have been for this series. I know the outcome of all the relationships, the whole series, characters\\' lives (I wasn\\'t aware of Snape\\'s until about a week ago), etc. In spite of all that, I\\'m still somehow loving this series. Again, after Deathly Hallows I hope I know whether it is my favorite series ever. \\n This is the first Harry Potter book that I have read in a normal amount of time (all of them have previously taken me 1 day, a week, or two weeks to finish) so I feel like completing this in 4 days contributes to how much I loved this book (even though I obviously would have loved it just as much.) \\n Again, as a reference point to future Savannah: you just sat and read this book for about 6 hours in 2 hour segments in your last 2 days of reading it. \\n I don\\'t really have anything else to say. I just. Wow., 1/6 - Starting Slow but nice \\n 2/6 - Momentum but nothing yet \\n 3/6 - OH yeah, things were getting good \\n 4/6 - Got confusing... \\n 5/6 - Awesome Awesome \\n 6/6 - Kinda confusing and awesome at the same time \\n EPiLOGE - BOOOOM!!! Awesome!!! \\n Loved the book, took forever to read, but I really enjoyed the middle and the end. There are parts of this book that are better than the other books, but the second book I think will be my favorite., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Welp, I see were coming to the end of the series. Dumbledore is dead and Harry is now going to dedicate himself to hunting Voldemort, I\\'m excited for what is to come, and I really enjoyed the last bit of cheeky British happiness, ** spoiler alert ** \\n So I\\'m a bit surprised about the ending of this book. Like why did Harry have to break up with Ginny? I mean like Hinny for life! I\\'m kinda angry at Harry right now. Like he\\'s being overprotective. Even though he kinda has a point. \\n All in all, my favourite Harry Potter book so far!, Thrilling!, These books just get better and better., Wow...I think this is my favorite of the seven books!! \\n Of course the unexpected death of one of the main characters put me to tears for several minutes. \\n But DEFINITELY an amazing book!You have to read it...after the other ones of course!, after all these years i hsve finally gotten this far. it was an epic tale. im deeply saddn by dumbledore and hoping to understand some un answered questions. Harry is very brave, cunning and has a lot of heart to do what others cant or unwilling [cowardrist] to do., Ugh this book still makes me cry, years later. I cannot believe how the book ends -- or what I know what will happen in the future., I just feel like I got shot in the heart. Holy crap., 5th time through this one & I still get so stink in\\' sad by the ending. I think Bill\\'s injury hit me hardest this time through. And Harry\\'s \"lucky\" day was more funny than other times I\\'ve read it. I just love going through these adventures again and again., last read December 2011. \\n read Nov 2013 \\n read October 2014, :(, Re-read #??? completed 12/6/14 (1st re-read via audiobook): Well. It\\'s so interesting to see how much my opinion has either stayed the same or changed with my re-read after so many years. The Half-Blood Prince was one of my favorites since the last time I read it (at least 5 years ago if not 10. Clearly I was not good at keeping track) and I think it\\'s safe to say that it\\'s still my favorite of the entire series. I love everything that happens with Harry\\'s knowledge and seeking of information about how Lord Voldemort is as well as the fact that the book still largely takes place at school (I still love book seven but the fact that Hogwarts is mostly missing is something that I really did miss from the book). It may be in part since I realized that I actually haven\\'t seen the movie in forever so the book was really in the forefront of my mind instead of the movie version of events... I also am not a huge fan of movie Ginny and she still feels very much like a secondary character in this book still but she\\'s starting to really have more of a presence. I tried to put movie Ginny out of my mind and it helped a bit (poor Bonnie) and the relationship between Harry and Ginny in the book is SOOOOOO much more natural than in the movies. \\n Anyway. Love the information we get in this book. Still solidly one of my favorites -- no wait. My actual favorite -- of the series. \\n Full review posted HERE on The Book Addict\\'s Guide 1/23/15: ** There WILL be spoilers for this book (and the final book) so if you haven\\'t read it yet, BEWARE. You\\'re gonna get spoiled! ** \\n I felt a bit of pressure before starting HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. It\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve re-read all of the books but I always claimed this one as my favorite of the series. After realizing how much my opinion of ORDER OF THE PHOENIX had changed, I was totally unsure of how HBP would go. \\n Right off the bat, though, I was still in love. I just love how this book really brings everything to the next level -- from the plot to the adventure, Quidditch to romances -- everything just gets bigger and better in HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. I think one of my favorite things about it is the introduction to Horcruxes. I just really love the layers that it adds to the plot and how it adds another sense of adventure for the characters. I also really, really love that we get to know more about the villain\\'s past. I LOVE when the reader gets to know more about the villain and his backstory. I think it adds so much to a book and even makes that villain a bit more human -- whether that\\'s by a little or a lot. We all know how amazing J.K. Rowling is at her world building in these books so I guess I should never be surprised but that really is one of my favorite things about the entire series. \\n I really wasn\\'t big on many of the romances in this series. For me, Harry Potter was always more about action, adventure, friendship, learning, and well... magic. Movie Ginny kind of ruined book Ginny for me so I was really trying to give book Ginny another shot since I know where this story goes... I felt like she actually wasn\\'t hugely present in HALF-BLOOD PRINCE still so I didn\\'t feel like I had the opportunity to be bothered or charmed by her. She did make many appearances at the Slug Club parties and Quidditch matches, etc but for some reason I still felt like she wasn\\'t a very big character... I\\'m really interested to see how I feel about her in book seven because so far reading the books, I still don\\'t feel a lot! I do, of course, love the Ron and Hermione romance. You know I love best friendships turning into something more and this was a long time coming. It\\'s really interesting to see how this tension has slowly built and comes to its breaking point at the end of HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. \\n As always, I love the layers upon layers of world building. From getting to know more about Voldemort to the different classes the students take to the different places they visit... I just love getting lost in this world and something about the writing just makes me feel like it\\'s a real place, just out of my reach. I always love learning more about magic and what the rules are and what the limitations are. The Felix Felicis chapter is still one of my favorites and the cave scene at the end still creeps me out a lot. Then of course we have Dumbledore\\'s death. I\\'m not sure why -- maybe I know the books/movies too well? -- but I never really feel shaken by the deaths in these books (except for probably Fred, oh god, how will I read that) so I really didn\\'t get too worked up over his death... But I think for Dumbledore, it doesn\\'t really feel like he\\'s gone, you know? His portrait is in the headmaster\\'s office and we know he sort of... appears to Harry in the final book too. It\\'s Dumbledore. He\\'s the greatest wizard of all time. He may be dead but only kind of? \\n The great news is that HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE still stands as my favorite of the series so far! I was never able to place my love for the final book so it\\'ll be interesting to see where I come out on this re-read! \\n Ranking after re-read of book #1: [1] // [6, 4, 5, 7, 3, 2] \\n Ranking after re-read of book #2: [1, 2] // [6, 4, 5, 7, 3] \\n Ranking after re-read of book #3: [3, 1, 2] // [6, 4, 5, 7] \\n Ranking after re-read of book #4: [4, 3, 1, 2] // [6, 5, 7] \\n Ranking after re-read of book #5: [4, 3, 1, 5, 2] // [6, 7] \\n Ranking after re-read of book #6: [6, 4, 3, 1, 5, 2] // [7], I finished this book right before I went to Disney and forget to review it back then... Anyway, it was absolutely amazing, and I loved every minute of reading this book!, So good, but the ending made me so sad, I can\\'t believe I waited so long to read the books. As usual the book is way better than the movie! They should make a series that is true to the book it will be amazing!, Better every time I read it., I loved the Harry Potter books up to this one. This one fell flat for me in many ways. The first was the tendency to \"send the characters to the clues\" rather than taking them there naturally. For example, Despite all evidence to the contrary, Harry just knows that another character is up to something just because that character is bad. And guess what, he is! It felt forced and lazy and it lacked the natural flow of the first five. \\n My second problem is that, despite all the hand wringing and long talks and use of Dumbledore\\'s pesieve, very little actually happens in this book until the final couple chapters. In the end I was left feeling like I\\'d gone through a lot of pages with little to show for it. \\n The book does do a good job setting up the final book, which is important. And it finally resolved Harry\\'s relationship issues (something I\\'d been waiting for since book four). And the good luck potion sequence was one of the funniest in the series (albeit a bit too convenient). I just wish it could have done those things with the same flair as the previous Harry Potter outings. \\n In the end, I was dissappointed., Good book. I liked it much more than the fifth book I think. Harry starts to come into his own and scene is finally set for the finale. Seventh book here I come., Long Live Harry, etc. \\n Love the books more than I do the films., Still sad., With Harry\\'s occlumency lessons with Professor Snape a resounding failure, he begins lessons with Dumbledore instead. Together, they explore memories collected by Dumbledore in an attempt to better understand Lord Voldemort. \\n Meanwhile, Harry has found an old textbook filled with the notes of the previous owner - known only as the Half-Blood Prince. The notes help Harry excel in his Potions class, but after the encounter with the evil book in The Chamber of Secrets, Hermione has some reservations about using such a powerful book. \\n There was some interesting play with morality in this volume. Not to give too much away for the three people left on earth who haven\\'t read the series yet, but Harry has to cause harm to someone he loves for the greater good. It\\'s an extremely powerful scene that marks the tone for the rest of the series. \\n Seriously, I was bawling., I love the Harry Potter Series, Gotta say, this book was my favorite. I feel like it had the most out of the whole story! Of course, the other books have to be read before this one to understand the story. It\\'s definitely worth it., I was not very happy with Order of the Phoenix so I was overjoyed when reading this to find that my fuzzy Harry Potter feelings had come back!, \"Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\", Of course it\\'s 5 stars! It takes me almost 3 weeks to finish a 652 pages book, which is not so me but, reading slump for short. omygoodness I cry, Simply awesome., series getting better as harry gets older. more complicated,just like the real world, This is definitely one of my favourite in the series, 2015 reread thoughts: this book is always such and anomaly to me because somehow I missed its original launch when it first came out and waited a YEAR to read it and somehow avoided all spoilers. \\n 206 reread thoughts: the humor and playfulness and Teen Drama of it all contrasted with the Evil Forces makes this one of the most enjoyable Potter reads, This book is the Empire Strikes Back of the series., J.K. Rowling, you cannot end a book like this. You\\'re not a Pantip user., This book........ It has broken me. I don\\'t think I will ever be the same. Dumbledore I NEED YOU! You just can\\'t be gone...... No No Noooo:( Snape and that little piece of shit Malfoy will pay with their lives. Even though I know that\\'s not what you would want. DUMBLEDORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!:( <3, MY favorite of all the HP books., Life gets darker in the sixth in the series. The pace was better then the last book, but I really didn\\'t care for the cliffhanger ending. I have little patience for books that don\\'t give some resolution. \\n Read my full review at Carstairs Considers., As always, these books are timeless. Enjoyed this audio book so much, Holy big-sobbing mess, Batman. *sniffle*, I liked it more than Harry Potter 4 and 5. Harry was so nice in this one. \\n but didn\\'t have a great story like the first three books. \\n Review to come., This is my favorite book in the series so far! \\n \"I am not worried, Harry, I am with you.\", Much better than the movie was. Movie dragged some, but the book had more action to fill the \"boring\" parts., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Despite reading this series about 5 years after everyone else, I have (overnight) become more or less obsessed with it; the more I read, the more I fall in love (and hate) with the characters and the more I admire J.K. Rowling. She is a MASTER, and as an aspiring author, someone I dream of being like when I grow up. These books have put me under a spell, and have managed to move me in ways that I never expected. When Sirius and Dumbledore died, I felt this giant sense of loss, like I had known them as well as Harry has. (I did cry when Dumbledore died, I admit). There was a man, given the chance, that I would have willingly died for. Now, I can\\'t wait to see the 7th movie and then read the book. As one of the promo phrases for HP7 states, \"Harry Potter is the saga of our generation.\" I couldn\\'t agree more. While I\\'m sure most of us would rather not have You-Know-Who be real, many of us have left our hearts somewhere in Hogwarts, and wish so badly we wern\\'t Muggles., khyly z shkhSyt dmbldwr khwshm mywmd. yn khtb rw bbt ynkhh hry w dmbldwr byshtr bh hm nzdykh shdn dwst dshtm. \\n pynsh khyly tlkh bwd. bwrsh brm skht bwd., I felt half way through it was getting boring and didn\\'t read it for a couple of days, but once I picked it back up and the surprises in the last third of the book came I couldn\\'t put it down. Can\\'t wait to read the Deathly Hollows now!, This one made me sad. But.... Hello? Its Harry Freaking Potter!!!, \"I am not worried, Harry, I am with you.\" \\n Five breathtaking, heartbreaking, flashing, utterly blinding stars. \\n This book has to be my favorite Harry Potter book thus far. I know I haven\\'t yet read Deathly Hallows, but, frankly it better be a MASTERPIECE to outshine Half-Blood Prince, in my eyes. Don\\'t ask me why, but I fell head-over heels in love with this book, 3x more than with the rest, for some reason. It\\'s not like J.K. Rowling\\'s writing changed in some way, or that Harry did something more extraordinary than in the rest of the books, but something about this one was just...literally perfection. My eyes had trouble getting hydration, because I couldn\\'t even close them for a millisecond, I was so focused and obsessed with the book. The plot thickens this time around, and we delve into Voldemort\\'s past, which was something that had always made me curious. I cried many tears, whilst reading this book. Not just sad tears, but joyful, ecstatic ones too. My obsession with Ron & Hermione and Harry & Ginny grew 175388328474 times more, I actually felt an intense pain once Harry had to do what he\\'d been dreading at the end. But more on that later. \\n (to continue reading, check out my full review on my blog! \\n https://itsabookishthing13blog.wordpr...), ***SPOILER ALERT!!!*** \\n Harry continues to mature, his understanding of the world continues to grow in sophistication, and the battle between the good and evil forces grows ever more perilous. The plot moves forward toward the ultimate confrontation between Harry and his nemesis. Voldemort\\'s character grows ever darker. Harry looses a valuable ally. In between, he learns more about magic, shows up Hermione, and develops a romantic entanglement. The writing is crisp and moves along quickly. \\n The minute I began to read the book, my heart couldn\\'t stop beating, my eyes couldn\\'t stop reading, and my hands couldn\\'t put the book down. Unfortunately, I saw the movie before reading the book. (yes I know, never judge the book by the movie) well, I might have to say, it\\'s true. You should read the book before watching the movie just because in the book it has more details and the movie will just make you cry and not understand the whole point. He fought, somebody dies, and everybody cries. But the book tells you so much more...You\\'ll just have to read it if you haven\\'t read it yet., I liked it better when there was noone dying, when I was happy at the end of the book when I wanted to come back to Hogwarts for next summer, but now I won\\'t come back. :( \\n (P.S. I am reading the next book), Terrific reread. Definitely noticed things I overlooked last time., Ofcourse this was a good book, I mean it\\'s Harry Potter! I loved it, I love Harry, I love Hogwarts, I love all his friends, and I love Dumbledore., Great setup for the finale of the Harry Potter saga. Leaves you with a big lump in your throat., Reading this again just reminds me how badly they screwed up the movie., I mean this is obviously the millionth time I read this book but, I am so sad right now. Everyone knows what happens at the end of this book., I don\\'t know why but this has always been one of my least favorite books in the series. Basically this means I love it but only love it, not really love it. I do love the movie though .... Which is weird. Oh well. This isn\\'t really a review as much as rambling so I\\'m done now., first read jan 2015 \\n second read 27/01/2017-01/02/2017, It\\'s not really a review, more like my favorite and least favorite parts of the book. \\n To see the \"review\" visit my book blog here!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n This book was really good. Had a lot of interesting parts of it, and I was absolutely shocked at the end with Snape. At the beginning when he made the unbreakable Vow, I still thought he was going to be a part of the order and trying to pull one over on Voldemort. I still can\\'t understand why Dumbledore believed him. This is also the part of the HP story where love matches are starting to occur. I\\'m so sad to see this series end. 3, Anddd I am crying. But this is just the preparation for the amount of tears that will come later. Amazing book!, So I watch the movie before reading the book (Yes you may wonder why I do such horrible thing). The thing is I used to not like reading especially big book or series like Harry Potter !! I just read and finished Harry Potter last year. I decided to read it because of my bucket list. I must finish Harry Potter before going to college. And I did and I loved it. Everything is just magical. (This is not my first fantasy series/trilogy though)., I literally inhaled this book the first time through. I enjoyed it much better the second time through, just this past summer. I swear I didn\\'t read the ending the first time through as this time it was like reading it for the first time., Una vez mas, me he encontrado llorando a lagrima viva ante la muerte que se produce al final de este libro... y eso que ya lo habre leido unas siete u ocho veces. \\n Como todos los libros de Harry Potter, este es fantastico. Aunque tiene un final oscuro, el libro es bastante mas alegre que su predecesor y, aunque el anterior me encanto, se agradece algo como esto justo antes de empezar la parte mas oscura y peligrosa de este fantastico viaje que son los siete libros de Harry Potter., Amo estos libros. Me hubiese encantado haberlos leido en mi infancia <3, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I am still ugly crying over Dumbledore\\'s death dY~, This book is 5x better than the movie. I think the books are all better than their film counterparts but this one especially., The audiobook is fabulous!, Finished reading this book in just half a day!, Still my favourite Harry Potter book by far. It\\'s the perfect balance between action, information and down time. A true masterpiece in literature!, I\\'m seriously angry. This book has made me too angry. How could...? I have to find out what happens next., I wish i could be at Hogwarts., AHHH MY HEART, This and the deathly gallows were my absolute favorite books in this series!!!, Another great Harry Potter book!, I felt really really awful when Dumbledore died. it was as if someone I knew in real life really did pass on. I\\'ve gotten attached to the old coot. \\n I also felt a little bit of hopelessness. I thought all was lost when Dumbledore passed away. thank goodness for Harry... although he was a little helpless at first. this book gave me the strength to believe in Harry. the belief that he really could defeat the dark lord., It\\'s Harry Potter. Does it even need a review!!?, Five out of five... basically..., Name: Sami B. \\n Class: 7 Red \\n Review: Unofficial \\n Pages: 652 \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince by J. K. Rowling begins with a strange visit from Dumbledore to Harry\\'s summer home with the Dursleys, and quickly evolves into a suspenseful tale of mysterious old friends, teleportation, and scalding potions. This book could quite possibly be the best one in the series, though I\\'m not sure it beats the seventh one. Well, I guess you\\'ll just have to read it and find out! I recommend this book to readers 12 and up. I enjoyed this book greatly, and I hope you will too! (less), This was an amazing novel from beginning to end, but I do have to say that my favourite parts of the novel were the parts that were completely missed by the movie. For example: the first chapter between the Prime Minister of England and the Ministry of Magic would have been perfect as a standalone short story. I wouldn\\'t have changed a word. As the beginning to this novel, however, it managed to navigate a perfect line between humour, recapping the story thus far and giving this amazing backdrop to drop the reader into. \\n Sadly, I feel that the first part to travel slowly in this book were the first conversations between Harry and Ron, but the story picked up quickly again after that. \\n I\\'ve heard a lot of people complain about how often Harry is on Draco\\'s back, utterly convinced that he\\'s \\'up to something\\' only to be proven right at the end, as of course we know from the conversation between Snape and Narcissa near the beginning. Maybe it\\'s because I first read Rainbow Rowell\\'s humorous take on this genre, Carry On, that I found this to be an amusing truth of the story, rather than annoying. \\n Back to movie/novel comparisons, I think I was most surprised by the difference that Helena Bonham Carter brought to the character of Bellatrix in the books. Both were interesting, though. I\\'m not sure which I preferred. \\n This book has been out so long that I almost don\\'t believe there are any spoilers to be given anymore. So saying, the last movie/novel comparison I\\'ll make is the several passages surrounding Dumbledore\\'s death. I... was devastated reading it here. My whole world changed. I couldn\\'t put the book down. I couldn\\'t look away. I was right there with Harry as everything he\\'d known before changed. It was... perfect. Easily the very best part of the book. I loved exactly how much Rowling lingered on this significant death. I always felt it was far too quickly glossed over in the movie, and likewise in Sirius\\' death within the previous book of this series. \\n All in all, very little to fault. A very strong addition to the story, perfectly paced and gearing us up for the big and final battle between Harry Potter and Valdermort in the final novel., This one was hard for me to get into and it started off really slow, but the ending was like BAM! The last hundred or so pages had me curled in a ball and holding my breath as I read. It was worth the slow start!, I basically love Harry Potter as much as I love the Twilight series. I even stood in line past midnight to receive a copy of one of the HP books! That\\'s a big deal for me ;-). Every Harry Potter story is a big favorite for our entire family. We are very sad that the movie series is almost complete. I remember finishing the final book and feeling such a deep feeling of sadness and loss because I could no longer be a part of the character\\'s lives. JK Rowling is a genius, and I am truly jealous that I didn\\'t come up with the idea first!! ;-), awesom, Lots of talking but still loving it... Dumbledore, we\\'ll miss you.., this book is sooooo not awesome, DUMBLEDORE\\'s death make this book becomes worst. but i still love the book., I\\'m going to review these as a series since it\\'s been awhile since I read them. Just know that Deathly Hollows was by far my favorite. \\n The series starts off slow and relatively innocent but really picks up the pace around book 3 - The Prisoner of Azkaban. The writing is spot-on, never lulling the reader into a detail-ridden coma, but instead begging to be read late into the night. These books are so well-written and enjoyable and perfect for re-reads., The best Harry Potter book!!, My Review Here., I\\'m sad that my re-read of the series is coming to an end, but elated that Tom has started reading them and is seriously enjoying them! We\\'re watching the movies as soon as he finishes each book and both playing through the Lego Harry Potter series. Although I could do without him telling me everything that\\'s different in the books (open-wound people!), but it\\'s still exciting that he\\'s enjoying them. \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is DEFINITELY in the top half of my arbitrary which Harry Potter books do I like more list. In this book more than any other, I believe, we truly see just how much potential Rowling has. She begins tying up loose ends while at the same time keeping the story moving forward in such a way that you can\\'t stop reading. This book more than any other (except for perhaps the first) provides the stage and set for the final novel. And as such - the wait for the final novel was by far the hardest and the longest (seeming)! \\n Click here to continue reading on my blog The Oddness of Moving Things., Really good. I loved it. I love all these books though... lol. \\n Really neat to finally learn more about Professor Snape though. I liked that you find out how awesome he is at potions . \\n The love stories took a turn in this one too. It played the story well, and was so full of information i was dying to finish the book!, This is my most favorite book of the whole HP series. This book was a roller coaster ride of emotions, drama, mystery and tragedy for me as a potterhead. For me, this is the best book of JK Rowling up to date., All of the Harry potter books deserve 5 stars, and this is no exception. Absoulotly amazing, and brilliant. I was crying so much at the end, I couldnt even see the words. This you may think is a reason to not read it. It is not. It just thickens the plot, as they say. One word- AMAZING! A must read for all ages. READ IT!, It\\'s amazing but saddening. It\\'s like a book of failure. No victory for harry in the end., Highly recommended!, Reread July 26, 2015, As the Harry Potter books have ventured into darker, more mature territory, the series has greatly improved in one regard: The stories feel more epic, the tension more real.., pissed a little about no rules of that magic world. And Potter boy raging blindly. Those emotions tho, I just can\\'t get around the thought of what happened in this book! My insides are churning, my eyes are burning, and my heart is racing(well I Am also crying! But that is besides the point) This book is just a mere reminder of the power that words can wield , and what they could cause a person to think,and feel! I was thunderstruck by how this book made me feel! I can\\'t express the feeling using normal words, or a language. I just felt EVERYTHING! I was in awe when I finished this book, the way I think is completely different now. Some people may say this is cheesy or something, but guess what if you don\\'t believe in the power of words then you definitely never read anything useful! The whole purpose of books is the knowledge that you gain while enjoying yourself! I feel myself growing wiser and wiser as I continue my reading journey! But man this book was just AAAAGG!! This book definitely hit some interesting psychological topics that made me think, and delve inside my thoughts. This book just simply made me feel!, My heart is full [?][?][?], Obviously a re-read but still so good!!!, Rereading the serIes. All the feels again. No review really needed., Incredible, i think the best one so far, but so sad that Dumbledore dies:(, Another favorite in this series I will admit besides the heart wrenching ending, of course., How? How? How? \\n This book went by so fast. I feel a pang of emotions-- mostly sad, somewhat happy. I can\\'t believe this series is finally coming to an end. I admit that it took me a long time before I started reading Harry Potter, but now that I come to think of it, I am so grateful that I did. \\n Bradbury once wrote in one of his books, that great writers \"touch life often,\" and that great books \"have pores.\" With no doubt, J.K Rowling is one of those authors. She touches life on every page of her books. Her books have pores. The characters, the culture, the child-like satisfaction of reading it, and so much more. As you come closer to the end of this book, you notice how its only a few authors, Ms. Rowling being one of them, who can write with such poise that you come to feel happiness and despair after reading. \\n Though this book has left me with a pile of emotions, crying over the ending, I will leave you to it to find your adventure along Harry Potter, if you end up reading this eloquent yet tangible novel., I\\'m so sad, but this book was so great. So far, my favourite book in the series. \\n Review up sometime... if I can get out of bed D:, I think this is my favorite one. This one or Prisoner of Azkaban., So I hate whiny main characters and Harry is in full whiny mode for this book. Above and beyond that though nothing happens....it is a 700 page book that is just a prequel for book 7 and that annoys me to no end. On the plus side Rowling\\'s writing is fantastic, so 2 instead of 1 star., It was fairly slow at the start (although that might have just been because I was in a reading slump), but towards the end the book really picked up and I enjoyed it thoroughly., Oh hey, Ginny Weasley has an ACTUAL PERSONALITY., Dumbledore is dead, at the end just like the last book where Sirius Black die and its was difficult to believe same like that happens in this one, once again sad ending., December 2016 re-read: Fantastic as always. Remains my favorite book in the Harry Potter series., I enjoyed it, although the Order of the Phoenix was better IMO., :(, I thought that Rowling had lost her touch in the latter books, but there was some good parts to this. I really enjoyed the potions bits and that Harry was finally good at potions. Plus, I just like reading about recipes and bubbling potions!, Getting darker and darker. J.K. Rowling knows how to make you feel something. I was moved by the ending., Ha Sido Un Libro Hermosamente Triste, Me He Reido y Llorado Tanto, (Mucho Mas En Las ultimas Paginas). \\n Ame Volver a Hogwarts Y Ver a Harry, Ron ,Hermione.... (A Todos Los Personajes), Pero Fue Horrible saber que Era la ultima vez que Iba a Ver a Uno de Ellos., The war against Voldemort is not going well; even Muggle governments are noticing. Hermione scans the obituary pages of the Daily Prophet, looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. \\n And yet... \\n As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate -- and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. \\n So it\\'s the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here at Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort -- and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability., Luna Lovegood is my idol, This one is my favorite of the series!, A very dark instalment of the series. Part of what has made Harry Potter so successful is that the books matured as the readers did. The sixth book was, therefore, the darkest up until that point. Heavy, dark, brooding, this tome began to unravel many of the mysteries Dumbledore had long been holding (horcruxes, Voldemort\\'s early life and rise to power, etc.). In this way it was a very satisfying book to read because I felt like I was finally getting some answers. \\n But this book also gave us a glimpse as to what Harry is in for in book seven, The Deathly Hallows. We can see that the series is only going to get more grim. The death of Dumbledore is what really hammered this point home for me. As a mentor, comforting figure, a powerful magical force and a leader against Voldemort, Dumbledore represented the strength to be found on the side of the Order of the Phoenix and its supporters. With his death I realised how difficult the path ahead was going to be. Harry has always found sanctuary with Dumbledore, no matter how frustrating or distant their relationship appeared to be. The choice Rowling made when killing this character was a smart one. By killing Dumbledore she left Harry feeling alone and left the reader feeling afraid for the future for (at least in my opinion) the first time. Even though there are many good and magical adults still alive at this point, no one can fill Dumbledore\\'s immense shoes. \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince doesn\\'t just mature into dark themes, it begins to cover more and more of the romantic feelings various characters have for one another, mostly between Hermione and Ron, Ron and Lavender and Harry and Ginny. We get to see these characters beginning to really grapple with their feelings. This is the first time - besides fleetingly with Harry and Cho in books four and five - that we see this new dimension to the characters. This is fascinating, but also feels rushed at times and slightly forced. Especially the Harry and Ginny \\'love story\\' that got thrown at us. It felt like it came out of nowhere and was largely unnecessary. I was also left feeling vaguely pissed off when he fell in love with a Weasley. Really? Are there no other girls? It felt very Star Wars to me. \\n All in all this is a very good book and an important installment in the Harry Potter series. Even though there are other books I like more (PoA, DH etc.) this is still an enjoyable read., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I loved this book as one of my favorite books. I really hate the part where Dumbledore dies though because its so sad. The fact about how the Horxrux wasn\\'t even real though and Dumbledore died for it is even more sad., As eager as I am to move on to the next book, I\\'m sad to leave this one behind., this is the first HP i\\'ve read in ten years and while I liked it and plowed through it in a couple days, I couldn\\'t help feeling disappointed. I\\'ve realized that I read HP for the details. The moving paintings, wacky spells, neat toys and places. But by this 6th installment all that\\'s gone stale and has taken a backseat to the plot, which is as convoluted and holey as that of any other lengthy scifi/fantasy series. The characters are either aggravating (obsessive Harry) or completely batty (artificial Snape shocker) or typified smart-girl-teen doing something typically smart-girl-teenish, like I\\'m being really bluntly baited to project myself or a friend onto this character to connect to them. Whatever, it young-adult. \\n JK Rowling is a superb young-adult writer. I\\'d love to teach this book to a class with its addictive plot rhythm and cool literary tricks. Otherwise yeahhh I guess I\\'ll finish the series, I cried so hard in this book :(, Ah emotions, \"Happiness can be found in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.\" - Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore \\n Your wisdom would guide me through life... \\n Farewell, mighty phoenix!, After the letdown of \\'Order of the Phoenix\\', I was happy to realize that I was really enjoying the writing and mystery of this edition detailing Year #6 at Hogwarts. \\n Harry\\'s Spells class runs out of new \\'recipe\\' books, so an old book that was lying around in the closet. The book was previously owned by somebody named Prince. Prince added many notes to the brewing of the spells, and whenever Harry followed these additional instructions, his concoctions always succeeded. Who was this Half-Blood Prince? I had many theories, including Harry\\'s mother, but was wrong on all of them. She fooled me on this one and it was good choice what makes all the sense in the world once revealed. Very good. \\n I liked this book all the way to the very end where things really started to fall apart for me. Dumbledore drinking all of that lagoon water which made him dipsy made no sense to me and seemed completely out of character. And for what? They didn\\'t find the key to destroying Voldermort. Only a clue to another person who is out for Voldermort with the initials R. A. B. Isn\\'t it a little late in the series to be introducing new mysteries and characters like this? \\n Yet another Major character is killed off. I felt this was more for shock value than anything else and it all seemed so meaningless. \\n And most disturbing to me... Harry quits school! What kind of message is this for children? \\n A frustrating last couple of chapters., This book i will admit has me in tears by the end, it is really quite moving, especially when you have read all the books and have become attached to the characters and the world they live in. A good story with an ending that is both tragic and unexpected., It\\'s funny how memory works wonders on a book. I remember being less annoyed over Harry\\'s obsession with Draco. I only really got trapped in the story when Dumbledore took Harry to locate the first Horcrux. Overall, it still is in my favourites HP books., My favorite of the series., This is where the rubber meets the road for our boy wizard. Dumbledore finally invests some time in him. He trusts his instincts even when no one else does. (And I was pretty annoyed with R & H for not giving him a little more credit.) He makes some pretty big mistakes but he does some things right, too. He really grows up in this one, and it totally sets the stage for what is coming next. I love how he sticks by his friends even when they don\\'t support him. His loyalty really shines., Excellent, Neden her kitabin sonunda kendimi aglarken buluyorum. Harry Potter\\'i duyunca artik hem sevgi pitirciklari hemde bir huzun hissediyorum... Diger kitaplara gore Melez Prens\\'in ilerleyisini biraz daha yavas buldugum icin bir puan eksik verdim yoksa yine tum guzelligi ile hikayemiz devam ediyor., After finding myself disappointed with the fifth novel, I enjoyed the change of pace and tone in \"Half Blood Prince.\" The introduction of Horcruxes and the powerful betrayal at the ending set the stage for the finale., My absolute favorite of the Harry Potter series. I loved the back story we received, the dark tone of the book, its heartbreaking and fantastic ending, and the overall sense of excitement, adventure, darkness, and human-ness that pervaded the story. Absolutely wonderful., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Harry Potter and the half-blood prince is an inspiring and captivating novel . I\\'d like to share the parts that were most interesting. \\n The novel begins with Snape . Snape,who is trusted by Dumbledore,and presents the reader with a paradox. \\n Snape takes upon himself the task that was bestowed upon Draco Malfoy by Voldemort . \\n Next,Harry potter is fetched from the Dursley\\'s by none other than Dumbledore and brought to an old acquaintance of Dumbledore,whom Harry has to convince to teach at Hogwarts. \\n Meanwhile,Dumbledore tells Harry of his ownership of Sirius\\'s home,private lessons(with Dumbledore),Dumbledore escorts Harry to the weasley\\'s and from there he travels to Hogwarts. \\n Due to sighting Malfoy in a dark arts shop and other reasons,Harry suspects that Draco is now a death eater. \\n The instructor Harry convinced to teach Professor Slughorn at Hogwarts takes up potions and Snape becomes the dark arts professor. Harry doesn\\'t have a potions book and borrows one from slughorn,which happens to be the property of the Half blood prince. Herein he leaves many new spells and excels in potions. \\n Dumbledore shares memories that shed light upon Voldemort\\'s life and rise to power. \\n Harry notices Dumbledore\\'s blackened hand,(which Dumbledore dismisses when asked),and later discovers that it is due to an Horcrux object. \\n There are few attempts to curse Dumbledore,with the sender unknown.it is quite unfortunate that students become cursed ,rather than the attempts being foiled altogether. \\n Harry began do develop feelings about Ron\\'s sister:Ginny Weasley. \\n Harry discovers Riddle\\'s obsession with Horcruxes in Dumbledore\\'s lessons and is bequeathed to request the memory from slughorn (regarding Horcruxes). \\n Harry than discovers that Malfoy is spending much time in the requirements room,which he eventually used to bring in death eaters. \\n Harry discovers that Voldemort has split his soul by means of Horcruxes. \\n Harry discovers that Snape told Voldemort about the prophecy and led to the murder of his parents. \\n Dumbledore takes Harry with him upon a mission to destroy a horcrux and Dumbledore becomes weakened due to drinking a liquid that would allow them to retrieve the horcrux. \\n Upon their return,they discover that death eaters have entered Hogwarts and that Draco wants to kill Dumbledore. Snape then comes and kills Dumbledore and (the half blood prince aka Snape) the flee. \\n To Harry\\'s dismay,the Horcrux is a fake and had been retrieved already. \\n In conclusion,this novel has been an amazing read.due to all of the occurrences., What happened? She was on such a roll....and then this. I struggled through this one. I got bored. I didn\\'t feel sucked in, like the rest of them. Still love the characters..., 4.5, 2010 grade A \\n series book HP6 \\n audio novel, Loved it! Lots of action. Death of a major character. Tragedy, love, faithfulness. Horcruxes! Snape! The characters continue to mature and grow. This is one of my favorite in the series. Now on to The Deathly Hallows., Why isn\\'t lupin and tonks in it more? I think they are cute...... \\n But nothing I write will add anything more to the thousands of reviews there already is., Stephen King says:\"The miracle of the Harry Potter series is that it keeps getting better. The genius of Ms. Rowling was her decision (probably never even seriously considered at the time) to follow Harry through his schooling. As a result, Harry\\'s fans have never left him behind. The question is whether Ms. Rowling will be bound to him for life, as Arthur Conan Doyle was bound to Sherlock Holmes.\" He recommended audiobook, too. \\n I loved them all! Read \\'em twice!, Amazing how much reading a person can get done when they don\\'t go to work - thanks for the sick day Ella, Loved it. I think J. K. Rowling\\'s on to something here., Magnificent book!! Much better than the film adaption., Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince written by J.K Rowling is the sixth book out of seven in this series, published in 2005. The book is mainly about the growing war against Voldemort and trying to find ways to destroy him. This is the part where there are many changes happening to Harry, Herminone, and Ron. They are growing up and their relationships are evolving. Snape is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and no longer teaching potions. The Harry Potter series is simply wonderful and I love every single one of the books, but I think this one is my favorite out of all., The saga has taken an interesting turn!, Audiobook: 4/3/17, Every Harry Potter book is awesome, No doubt..., I am glad I chose to re=read the series this summer. There is so much detail in each book and I was in such as hurry to read them when I first got them that there were things that I didn\\'t really absorb. I will have to wait until I am at my sister\\'s again to get The Deathly Hallows and complete the cycle, I was amazed at first by how much bickering goes on between Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but then I though about it and such a tight group of friends whom have grown up together in the most important years, and are opposite sexes, and two of which obviously secretly harbor thoughts of love for each other, bickering was only natural. It even made me love this book more. They are all growing older and the themes and what is going on with them matures to, it is gradual and amazingly done. \\n Secondly this book is one that made me think and pause. I was constantly trying to figure out the mysteries, who is the Prince, Snape was on my list all along, what are Horcruxes. But it made me pause cause it really shows how fine the line is between a good wizard and a dark wizard. We see Voldemort, evil in the making, while Harry wrestles with his own extremes, and how far into dark magic he will go for good., I...I can\\'t even begin to describe my thoughts on this installment. This book had the Hogwarts charm the earlier books had that was absolutely amazing. The characters have grown so much. They have all become wonderful people that i genuinely care about. Harry especially. You can really tell he grew in this book. He\\'s less arrogant and can control his temper somewhat. I can\\'t decide which character is my favorite though. All of them are awesome or are fun to hate. The ending killed me though. I am not okay. \\n I am in awe of how Rowling created this magical world that never gets boring. I have seen all the movies but yet I was still shocked and hurt and happy every chapter. (The movie does not do the ending of the book justice except for the wands scene in the movie) Rowling really knows how to write. Every book gets more fascinating as you turn the pages. My favorite part was the scene that Harry learned about Voldemort\\'s past. They were so interesting. \\n I cannot believe it is almost over. I don\\'t know how Harry Potter fans dealt with it. I\\'m not sure if I can get to the last book. I cannot believe I only have one more book left. Harry Potter fans had to deal with it longer than I have though. I get it now. I get the fuss. \\n I can\\'t pick a favorite book from the series but this is up there. Wow, Simply amazingdY$?\"!!! From this moment forward I know that I will always have to re-read Harry Potter year after year. Yeap, I\\'m a life long fan at this point!, This remains my favorite out of the series. (We will see if things change after my re-read of Deathly Hallows, however.) Some of the chapters give me chills in this, creeped out chills. Because some parts of this book are really, truly terrifying. And J. K. Rowling is so good with her descriptions that it\\'s easy to get caught up in the bookish atmosphere. I cried, I laughed, I stayed up thinking of certain scenes. I loved all the characters in this, especially Ginny. She was awesome in this. \\n I can\\'t wait to read the next one. I\\'ve forgotten so much that happens in these books that it\\'s almost like reading them for the first time. Having such a fun time., Oh Rowling, Rowling, Rowling...........I know this was a reread but that doesn\\'t mean I can\\'t rant about a book again , okay? \\n Well, alryt I am not going to rant. Just say few simple words. \\n The moment I was finished I was in uncontrollable streams of tears.........that continued for at least 20 minutes \\n after that I have had too equally painful outbursts.... \\n do I need to say anything else? \\n Perhaps one.......I love you with all my heart Rowling.............I swear i won\\'t die before I have met you in person, that is the aim of my life.... \\n I think I am done., Since I started re reading the Harry Potter books this Summer, Half Blood Prince was the one I was most looking forward to. Previously I read the book in one day in 2005, ten years ago. Therefore I\\'ve never really emerged myself in this book and was eagerly looking forward to the flashbacks about Tom Riddle I hazily remembered. I felt Order of The Phoenix was full of extraneous detail that the film makers were correct to abandon, yet the film for Half Blood Prince has always, to me, felt like something was missing. Snape finally becomes DADA teacher and yet in the film we never see a single one of his classes. I enjoyed these in the book, the love of quidditch, the relationships involved in the book and the funniest scene is when Trelawney is hiding her sherry in the room of requirement. I was not dissapointed with the flashbacks detailing Voldemort\\'s ancestry and the story of his poor mother Merope Gaunt. The book is fast paced and paves the way for Hallows. Seeing as Riddle\\'s diary was a horcrux I also think this book shares a lot in common with Chamber of Secrets. Spellbinding., Reread fueled by watching the movie and reading some quality fic., This is my new favorite of the HP series, followed closely by Goblet of Fire. \\n J.K. Rowling is incredibly talented and I have loved every one of the books in the HP series. You really get to know more about Voldemort, his past and how he grew up to become so evil in this book. I like the background story, because it hasnt been given this much depth in the past books. \\n Dumbledore\\'s way of slapping someone in the face with his words, in the politest way possible -of course, always brings a smile to my face. This book shows the close relationship between Harry and Dumbledore, which was very touching. \"Dumbledore\\'s man, through and through.\" \\n Through the whole book I was going back and forth on who I thought the Half-blood Prince would be, and was definitely surprised when it was revealed. \\n Now I must not waste any more time on this review, as Deathly Hallows is awaiting..., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Since I couldn\\'t remember the movie, I was excited to read this one and I wasn\\'t disappointed. It was hilarious, emotional, and gripping, everything that makes these books special. It was interesting to explore Voldemort before he became Voldemort, and to learn more about horcruxes. But Dumbledore! Poor Dumbledore! I knew I always had reason to hate Snape. Deathly Hallows won\\'t be the same without him., The sisxth year at Hogwarts. Harry is still realing from the death of his uncle Serious Black. When Dumbledor comes for him so they can start their task of finding Horcruxes. But first they must get one of Dumbledor\\'s friends to fill the post of potions master (Slughorn). They accomplish that, then they head towards Hogwarts. Harry meets up with Hermione and Ron and tells them everything that happened and that he will be meeting with Dumbledor so they can find more horcruxes. Snape finally gets his favorite position as professor of the Dark Arts and gives Harry and Ron a hard time. As the days grow long and short Harry has his meetings and they find the location of one of the horcruxes through a memory. It is in a cave. harry and Dumbledor go to this cave and they get a fake horcrux. When they get back to Hogwarts they find that it has been infiltrated by death eaters. The death eaters find them along with Malfoy who corners Dumbldor and tries to kill him. And like Malfoy he is to scared and Snape ends up killing Dumbledor. After the incident they bary Dumbledor in a white cascet. Harry then goes into the school and Ginny Ron\\'s sister follows him and they share a kiss. When Ron and Hermione are with Harry he tells them \"I\\'m not coming back, I\\'m going to find the rest of these horcruxes and finish him off once and for all.\" To which they say \" you are not doing this alone we are going with you.\" So they set goals for the finding of the horcruxes. Then they go home and start working on everything before they have to leave everyone they love behind., It\\'s been a while since a book has kept me up into the wee hours of the night. Can\\'t wait to see what the last installment holds in store., The Half Blood Prince is the sixth book in the series, following Harry through the sixth year of school at Hogwarts. The basics are the same, we see the school, the characters in a new adventure, a new plot to kill Harry and take over the world, and a new reason to try to stop it. As all this is going once watch the human element, being the growth of each person, their own questions, the relationships changing and the shifting of alliances and emotions. \\n Here the characters are older, they are coming up on the last years of school, the return of Voldemort is public knowledge and the world has changed in strange ways. Families are pushed in ways that no one would have thought. This year sees differences, and it ramps up for the coming final struggle. \\n The book is written so that you feel part of the story, part of the characters lives, wanting them to succeed and do well. It is a mark of a great author who can make you feel like you belong in the story., This was awesome!!! Go read it if you haven\\'t. Stop crying over the fifth book! Actually, I\\'m in no condition to tell you to stop crying... *SOB*, One more book left !!!!! :\\'), Poor Dumbledoor. I cried and cried when Dumbldore died. I wanted to shut the book rght there and pretend that never happened. But of course, read on..., Loved it, You\\'ve all heard of the book. If you haven\\'t read it yet & don\\'t want anything spoiled, don\\'t read beyond the cut. All I\\'ll say is that if you\\'ve read the first five books of course you\\'re going to get around to reading eventually and once you finish Half Blood Prince you\\'ll eagerly await the publication of the seventh book in the series. Grad school kept me from finishing it until now, so I\\'m sure I\\'m probably the only one who hasn\\'t read it yet. Anyway, \\n Since I\\'ve gotten into writing these reviews for more general reasons & I\\'m really not anywhere near the biggest HP buff out there, I\\'m not going to get into debates about who R.A.B. is, whether Dumbledore is really dead, or what in the world Snape is up to. I\\'ve never known anyone to acurately predict such things, so while I don\\'t mind a little idle speculation, I\\'m not going to devote any serious energy to figuring out something that Rowling will inevitably explain much more creatively and entertainingly than I could. \\n Two things that I\\'ve loved about the HP series that I think Half Blood Prince continued to do: \\n Rowling has continued to fulfill her promise of making sure that the style of the books mature with Harry. Ayear older and wiser than the moody teenager in Order of the Phoenix, Harry\\'s realizes there are more important things than getting pissed off at the world. He\\'s still a 16-year-old boy, though, so it\\'s not surprising that he gets frustrated with Dumbledore for not telling him everything right away, but I\\'m glad to see that he\\'s calmed down a little bit. \\n Even while dealing with more and more intricate plot details, or maybe because of that, Rowling still manages to craft a very great mystery, leading us one way, and in the end, showing us that it\\'s really something completely different. For example, with all the talk about werewolves and Draco\\'s mysterious disappearances and sickly appearance had me convinced that Draco had become a werewolf, which made me feel pretty stupid when the truth was revealed. I love that she\\'s still able to trick me after five books of getting used to her writing style. \\n Two other things I liked about Half Blood Prince specifically: \\n I love this whole Horcrux thing. It\\'s so satisfying to finally know how Voldemort can be defeated. As a reader I\\'ve been a little more satisfied about the ultimate mystery of the series, how to kill Voldemort, but at the same time I have to read the seventh book to find out if Harry is actually able to defeat him with this information. \\n Harry Potter finally gets a girlfriend! Ginny is way cooler than Cho, and it\\'s good to see \"The Chosen One\" hooking up with someone as talented and clearly on his side. I was starting to feel like Rowling was forgetting about raging teenage hormones, so it was also nice to focus more on Ron and Hermione\\'s seemingly never-ending dance around getting romantically involved. Plus \"snogging\" is among the coolest British slang ever. I approve of the many excuses to use it in this book. \\n Two things I was less than excited about in Half Blood Prince: \\n Harry breaking up with Ginny at the end of the book. She\\'s tough; she can take it. Besides she\\'s already a target as Ron\\'s little sister, which we\\'ve already seen. Besides, they weren\\'t exactly hiding their relationship, even if took Harry forever to get around to snogging her. Someone such as Draco Malfoy could easily inform Voldemort of Ginny\\'s even dearer place in Harry\\'s heart, even if they have broken up. \\n Harry isn\\'t returning to Hogwarts?!? Because of the way these books have been structured and the importance of Hogwarts for Voldemort makes it clear that Hogwarts will still figure in the seventh book. But Harry isn\\'t planning to be a student anymore? I\\'m just having trouble getting my head around this concept. \\n As for Snape killing Dumbledore: \"I\\'m not touching that with a 20-foot pole.\" \\n Since I\\'m so behind the times and I know everyone else has talked this book to death, I feel so unmotivated to get into it in detail on this. Being part of an uber-popular series also makes this book hard to review, so sorry for the lesser quality of this review., My full review is here on my personal website. I\\'ll post a few excerpts here, though: \\n 5.0 out of 5.0 stars \\n The very worst thing about this book is how Dumbledore died. I love that Draco couldn\\'t kill him, but for it to have been Snape was just heart-wrenching to me. \\n The very best thing about this book is Draco Malfoy! ;-) What can I say, I\\'m a sucker for blond bad boys. He wasn\\'t able to kill Dumbledore and I don\\'t think it because he was scared. That whole scene, actually, was pretty intense for me. And Snape... Poor Severus, having to kill his only real friend. *cry*, oh my word some things happened that I really didnt expect cant wait to read the final installment of the story !!!!, , Re-read. Love the growth of character in this one, and the insight into Dumbledore., I wish J.K. Rowling would write a book from Draco\\'s perspective. I feel really bad for him all through this book....., Read again March 29, 2014 \\n Re read again September 2015, One of my favs in this series!, To review the book now is pretty pointless but I\\'m doing it regardless. Everyone knows what a phenomenal series Harry Potter is. This book was beyond expectations. For those who still have doubts about reading the series or continuing it: just do it., I forgot just *how much* I enjoy this HP installment. Once DEATHLY HALLOWS came out, it was so all-encompassing, that you sort of forget just how great *THIS* book is. It is probably tied for my 2nd favorite of the series, along with Goblet of Fire (since Goblet of Fire is where it starts to take a more \\'adult\\' turn, tone-wise). Deathly Hallows, however, will remain the best of the series (it\\'s a masterpiece- Rowling brilliantly pulls *everything* from *every* book all together in the last novel), BUT this is a strong contender as well. A great read.--Jen from Quebec :0), This book seemed slower than the earlier books, but so many threads began to finally weave together with many questions answered., Wonderful. the best of the series so far, with a really sad finale. Can\\'t wait to see what happens in the last part., Ms. Rowling has done it again. Great read, Harry Potter., \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" - written by J K Rowling and published in 2006 by Scholastic. Another great installment in the Harry Potter series and a relief to return to some more familiar characters. \\n Second reading. Reading this series in closer succession has been a positive experience for continuity of the story line. This penultimate book focuses on Harry\\'s obsession with Snape\\'s allegiances and his frustrating inability to convince others of his concerns. And it certainly ends badly in that respect! Some favorites from this book: \"All the hands were once again at \"mortal peril.\" ** \"Dumbledore\\'s man through and through, aren\\'t you, Potter?\" ** \"He made seven Horcruxes, said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage.\" And soon the saga ends., 100000 times better than the movie! The details and the things that happen just keep you at your toes!, How not to love it?, This was much better than the last one. Like the beginning of the series, there was much more magic and wonder in it - but a little more grown-up, because of course Harry is now about 16. It *could* have been the last in the series - but there is plenty more material to suggest that there will be another book (and, of course, there is now). I look forward to the next book, not so much to find out \"what happens\", but because I enjoy the writing style., I\\'m surprised to find that Dumbledore dies. It was another great book., \"No need to call me \\'sir\\', professor.\", This was my second reread of this book, and sadly I did not enjoy it as much as I did the first time. i feel like there were certain parts of the book that dragged out a little bit too much, but overall I obviously loved this book and I always will. I think that reading it when I was just starting to get out of a reading slump was not the smartest idea, but when I got to the second half I flew through it and finished this in a day., Just does not get any better then this. Harry Potter will always be close to my heart. <3, Myslim, ze neni treba neco dodavat. Zase jeden z oslnujicich zazitku. J.K. Rowling proste umi psat!, RIP Dumbledore <3, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was my favorite book in the series! 5/5 stars!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n *spoilers alert* \\n Dumbledore died. F U Snape! :@, So many feelings, My favorite of the books, I think. Maybe tied with #7. But I just love how many things come together in this book, while Rowling still maintains suspense and surprises up her sleeve., Thanks to my beloved co-workers... \\n they spoiled Dumbledore\\'s death for me! but it was still super sad!, For more details about this book review, and other Harry Potter reviews, check out my book blog: http://girlof1000wonders.wordpress.com/ \\n Despite having committed, dedicated friends who have his back, Harry has not told Ron or Hermione about the prophecy. Only he and Dumbledore know what the prophecy says, although there is much speculation flying around in The Daily Prophet, which has know quite quickly changed it\\'s tune from Harry Potter/Dumbledore hater to Harry is the \"Chosen One.\" Dumbledore urges Harry to tell Ron and Hermione, but still is is reluctant. He does so, but leaves out the part about the prophecy possibly being about Neville, and how Voldemort chose Harry, thinking that\\'s who the prophecy intended (based on his very limited information). Dumbledore has also returned to school with a blackened, shriveled hand that he continually puts off explaining...as well as an interesting ring that was a Slytherin heirloom. Dumbledore also instructs Harry to carry his Invisibility Cloak with him at all times... \\n I noticed straight off in this book that Harry is exuding more thought processing than has been shown in previous books, and it\\'s due largely in part to the fact that Hermione and Ron aren\\'t as concerned with what Draco Malfoy is doing, where he\\'s going, and they don\\'t believe Harry when he admits that he believes Draco to be a Death Eater. And another very odd thing happens: Snape has been given the green light to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, a post he\\'s been pining to teach for over 15 years, and rejected each year. He is also firm in his belief that Sirius\\' death is Snape\\'s fault, due to Snape taunting Sirius\\' inability to really contribute to the Order, being holed up at 12 Grimmauld Place. \\n Harry is taking private lessons with Dumbledore and learns some interesting history about Lord Voldemort. Through these lessons he learns nothing he really doesn\\'t already know about Voldemort\\'s character, but he does learn extremely valuable information regarding Voldemort\\'s past. Meanwhile, Dumbledore is not getting along well with the new Minister of Magic, who was previously the head of the Auror department at the Ministry. And for good reason to, as we find out. The new Potions Professor, Slughorn, is trying to collect student who have strong connections to powerful or famous wizards into an exclusive club....and Draco is quite trite that he\\'s not been invited to join and partake of all the activities. \\n During a Potions class, Harry is assigned a temporary book that has additional notes for potion-making and even some made-up charms, with a scribbling on the back cover that the book belongs to the Half-Blood Prince. There\\'s no indication who this Prince is, but I immediately thought it was Voldemort - given that he\\'s always lamented and cursed his Muggle father. Harry, however, thinks that the Half-Blood Prince is his own father, James. Hermione is irritated that Harry follow\\'s the Half-Blood Prince\\'s annotations and directions and is suddenly excelling in Potions class - even surpassing Hermione. \\n However, just as a rift occurred before between Ron and Hermione, another one does...over the same set of circumstances: matters of the heart. Ron and Hermione are secretly crushing on the other, but are at odds about it. Ron is quite mean to Hermione, who avoids being present like Ron\\'s carrying the Black Plague. And there\\'s another unsuspected crush going on for Harry, and he\\'s apt to keep it secret and quiet. And the icing on the cake for the first semester is Katie Bell being cursed by a mysterious necklace that she mysteriously came into possession of and needed to deliver to someone...at Hogwarts. The very same necklace Harry say Draco Malfoy looking at years before. \\n To show off his fame (by association), Slughorn invites many to a Christmas party. Draco is found trying to sneak in, and an odd moment is exchanged between him and Snape. Harry secretly follows them and overhears a conversation that is quite questionable - and once again brings the matter of Snape\\'s loyalties and trust to the forefront. This information is of course brushed off by Ron, Mr. Weasley and Remus at Christmas, when a very unexpected and unwelcome visitor (by everyone but Mrs. Weasley) shows up at the Burrow: Percy - with the Minister in tow! The Minister essentially wants Harry to make the Ministry look good, and he wants privileged information of Dumbledore\\'s comings and goings. He gets quite angry when Harry refuses. This is quite a risky move, given the power the Minister of Magic holds and Harry\\'s shaky past with the Ministry. Even riskier, Harry openly admits that his is \"Dumbledore\\'s man, through and through.\" He has definitely declared his allegiance. \\n Upon the return to Hogwarts, Harry begins religiously hunting for Malfoy on the Maurader\\'s Map, hoping to catch him up to something...but at times, Harry can\\'t find Malfoy on the map! How can he be leaving the grounds? Other revelations continue to pop up for the remainder of the book, setting Harry on edge and making him continually wonder and ponder - and possibly jump to conclusions. Dumbledore sets him what seems an impossible task, but it is the final piece of the puzzle explaining how Voldemort came to be what he is - and the secret to possibly toppling his crudely-built empire of power. \\n This book will definitely leave you shocked, wondering and questioning just as Harry has always done. It will completely throw readers, and it leaves the fate of Hogwarts up in the air. I said of the last book that it was set set apart from the rest of the series because it was setting some big things in motion - and this book has definitely shown a glimpse of that. I expect Rowling to go no-holds-barred for the final book of the series., ** spoiler alert ** \\n It was another emotional ending. The plot again was genius and original., What is there to say, you either read them or you don\\'t. I read them. This was all right. Not so good as 3 or 5, better than 1, 2 and 4., I read this one when it came out but didn\\'t remember any of it really. Except the big huge thing that happened in the book. Even if it\\'s fiction, it\\'s like dementors are surrounding me or something...like I\\'ll never feel happiness again. Rowling has amazing talent to evoke readers to be so immersed in the story to cry (like I did during the 5th book) and feel as if you\\'ll never be happy again (like with this one). \\n I also feel like this book was a \"in-between\" book. It doesn\\'t feel like a whole book. There was no meeting with Voldemort at the end of the book and fighting him like the rest of the books. Most of the book was spent with many plots and questions and that all ended pretty swiftly in the last few chapters. That\\'s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5., How dare Snape ! Thumbs-Up !, As I haven\\'t read the later Harry Potter books as many times over, I can get through them a lot faster than say, number four (that book just feels like it drags on forever and ever). For those who haven\\'t read it (do such people even exist??), Harry now faces preparation for his inevitable battle with Voldemort, as well as his sixth year at Hogwarts and much harder subjects. Malfoy\\'s up to some dark tricks, and Snape still appears to be fooling Dumbledore. I do enjoy this book, I feel that the characters are really coming into the own, and their substance as people has become clearer. I also admire how Rowling has left little puzzles pieces all through the books, it is very well done. And now finally, finally, I am up to Deathly Hallows. Yay!!, In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry becomes more magically adept, develops a tighter relationship with Dumbledore in their quest for the history of Voldemort, and finds the right girl., Oh, JK... I think the Harry Potter series had escaped from your vision of it and was too big for you to control. \\n The first time I got to Half-Blood Prince, my interest had waned quite a bit, so returning to it this summer I could only recall the broad strokes -- Slughorn, and Dumbledore\\'s betrayal, and the people behind it, and the fact that we learned a lot about Tom Riddle\\'s backstory. Thus, I went into it with a mostly open mind, though I mistrust a lot of Rowling\\'s attitude towards her own world. \\n - I really liked how all the layers of corruption in the Ministry were revealed, and while it\\'s horrifying that the entire governmental system of this world is a giant miscarriage of justice, it did add depth to the story. But as with Order of the Phoenix, a lot of the narrative arcs and \"facts about magic\" implicitly support those prejudices. There\\'s a very condescending attitude towards people and creatures with different levels or kinds of magic, even from the \"good guys\" who are pro-Muggle. \\n - once you know that Draco was ordered to kill Dumbledore you can see his fingerprints all over the more sinister elements of the book and you can see how honestly terrified he is of the darkness he\\'s enacting, even as he keeps coming up with other plans. \\n - I always love learning about Tom Riddle\\'s backstory, and that\\'s really what this book was about, and most of the drama and romance in the present day was filler to support this infodumping. Finding out where he went after Hogwarts and who he killed and why was really really cool! \\n - But then Harry and Dumbledore talked about Merope Gaunt is just awful! I\\'m not defending her use of the love potion to coerce Tom Sr. to marry her, and I certainly don\\'t agree with them that he \"abandoned\" her once he was released from her magic. No, no, I\\'m talking about the conversation that goes: \\n \"Merope refused to raise her wand even save her own life.\" \\n \"She wouldn\\'t even stay alive for her son? She had a choice, didn\\'t she, not like my mother--\" \\n \"...She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother\\'s courage\" \\n Excuse me, but she\\'s not the first witch to die in the world?? It\\'s not like it was a selfish plot to become homeless and die in childbirth just so she wouldn\\'t have to deal with a baby?? Ugh!, moving on... \\n - I love the idea that the prophecy only had the impact it did because Voldemort believed so deeply in it that he acted on it, and then Harry responded in kind. I do not love the idea that all of the above worked because Harry is so ~pure of heart~ that he would want bloody vicious revenge even if he hadn\\'t heard the prophecy. First of all, logic fail. Second, in the literal next chapter he almost kills Draco Malfoy in the bathroom, lol, guess he was too purehearted not to. \\n - Actually, most of the ideas about how ~love magic~ and wizarding bonds work, are both inconsistent and pretty disgusting. On a related note, Harry\\'s \"monster in his chest\" re: Ginny, is terrible writing. \\n - I\\'m a little annoyed that three MAJOR plot points happen on the same night, namely 1. Dumbledore locates the cave with the locket Horcrux, 2. Malfoy fixes the Vanishing Cabinet, 3. Trelawney reveals that Snape was the spy who passed on half of the prophecy . I understand why she does this from a storytelling perspective, because it forces Harry to choose which one of those revelations to pursue, but as they\\'re only tangentially related, it seems like lazy writing. \\n I will end with some genuinely good things from the book \\n - Anything that comes out of McGonagall\\'s mouth \\n - \"There\\'s no need to call me sir, Professor\" \\n - Aragog\\'s funeral, Finished this at two o\\'clock in the morning. Scared the bejiminies out of me but I couldn\\'t stop., My absolute favourite Harry Potter book!, Probably the best of them!, When I reviewed Harry Potter #5, I said that was my least favorite HP book. I stand corrected. This one now holds that honor. It barely held my attention the first 3/4 of the book. The intermingling stories of the mystery of the half-blood prince, the various teen romances and arguments, and the new dark arts teacher all fell flat. The book does have a shocking ending, but only recommend this for the pure Harry Potter fan., Why am I heart broken? \\n Why do I feel so alone? \\n All I see is death... and misery... and more death... \\n My daddy.... my daddy is gone.... \\n Isn\\'t this supposed to be a children\\'s book? \\n ISN\\'T IT!? \\n T________T, Oh man, these books break my heart. I just want to hold Harry and make his pain go away!, I\\'ve always counted this book as one of my least favorites of the series (if not my least favorite), so I was surprised to find that I really, really enjoyed rereading it this time! There\\'s not an awful lot going on for most of the book...the memories and backstory of Voldemort are obviously the most important thing here. Harry\\'s obsession with Draco gets a little old, and there\\'s the whole Lavender and Won-Won catastrophe. But I really love the memory sections, and the Felix Felicis scenes are among my favorites in the series. And the end is done really well, from the cave to the very end, which always makes me cry., My favourite book series even now Im 30. My 8 year old daughter now shares my love for it too., I\\'m not okay... \\n I\\'m not okay.. \\n I\\'m not okay. \\n My heart is broken, yet mended, yet broken. \\n *** May Contain Spoilers, read at your own risk*** \\n Snape. D;< \\n Dumbledore. MEEP. \\n Lupin and Tonks. AWEE <3 \\n Ginny and Harry during after Ch.24 <3 \\n Ginny and Harry After page 646 <|3 \\n I\\'m a mess!, Have tissues on stand-by, All I can say is... THIS IS TOO MUCH SNAPE. I CANNOT EVEN DENY THE FACT THAT I CAN\\'T STOP HATING YOU AND YOU CAN\\'T STOP ANNOYING ME., relectura, Not much to say. It\\'s HP and this is about the 2oth time finishing it., Entaxei...eleos omos kapou paidia..ekhei maurisei e psukhe mou...Tzampa khareka me ton erota tou Khari!! \\n Me perimenoun polloi akome thanatoi;; Gia na xero delade.. \\n \\'E mallon, ase, de thelo na xero...Giati kai o titlos tou epomenou den einai kai polu entharruntikos :(, ** spoiler alert ** \\n Let\\'s take a moment to realize what just happened . . . although, I feel nothing because I already saw all this in the movie. But I only feel one thing, pity for our favorite bad-boy, Draco Malfoy, I understand that he was just trying to protect his family, and himself and said that he had no other choice but to do it. \\n From the start, I always hated him, yet his part in this book changed my mind. \\n Like people said, \\'The Malfoys are cowards!\\', but what\\'s with it that they are just protecting each other. \\n 5/5 stars, good job JK Rowling \\n (I kept walking past the last book but I\\'m not yet ready to read it., Originally read this book in July of 2009: \\n This is one of my two favorite books of the series, with the other being Deathly Hallows. Rowling does a great job of pulling the previous five books together and conveying new information in a succinct and extremely entertaining fashion, in contrast to OotP, which I felt was too wordy and over-written. The many layers of story lines and characters, combined with cliffhangers, made it nearly impossible for me to put this book down the first time I read it, and continue to have difficulty putting it down each time I have read it since. On this most recent journey through HBP, I read it to my 11 and 7 year old children, who were just as eager to hear what would happen next as I was when I first read it. I look forward to reading it again and again in the years to come., BEST EVER!!! \\n My most favorite of Harry Potter Series. \\n This book doesn\\'t need a review. It just doesn\\'t! \\n Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince is one of the finest novels I\\'ve read in a long long time., Would give this one six stars if I could. Favorite of all., I love love love Harry Potter! \\n This is tied for my favorite book (with DH). \\n The ending is wonderful. It\\'s kind of a series closing as we knew it, you know, as peaceful and defeating voldemort at his opening task to conquer all. (Chamber of secrets, stone, etc.) \\n This is the beginning of the end, when they start their horcrux hunt, and everything will be put to the test. \\n I can see how you wouldn\\'t like this if you don\\'t love Harry Potter, but I absolutely LOVE harry potter, so this was just another outstanding novel by Rowling., Harry Potter is absolutley timeless. It is a classic that will forever be remembered because of the intricate, all too real world J.K. Rowling created. <3 No need to individually review each novel, as they are all worth the five stars and wonderful. So I will simply copy and paste this into all my reviews for HP. \\n The most wonderful series. Ever. \\n Content: PG - Violence (just fantasy/magic), kissing throughout the books but pretty rare, mild rarely used language., Well that just ruined my whole day., best of the series, So it took me reading and re-reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince about 4 times before I finally picked up the book with the knowledge that the half-blood prince was NOT Voldemort. I\\'m not sure why I kept thinking that, even after re-reading the book that many times, but I did. So it was nice approaching the book with that knowledge firmly encased in my head this time. \\n I just finished re-watching the movie, and I have to say the book wins on this one, hands down. And this is, in my opinion, where you really start to lose out on things if you haven\\'t read the books and have only followed the movies. For example - how would you know what those things are that attack Harry and Dumbledore and that they are chased away by fire? How would you know where Harry got the knowledge to help Ron when he was poisoned by the mead (and furthermore, where was Rosmerta in all of this?). So many small details are left out of the movies, details that make the book so much richer and give so many answers. \\n While I appreciate that the movie did things to make them special, such as Harry and Ginny\\'s kiss, the tribute to Dumbledore, etc, the way the book had them laid out made me laugh out loud with delight, in the case of the kiss, and weep with sorrow in the case of Dumbledore. Rowling had hit her stride in the previous book and just kept pushing forward, making The Half-Blood Prince one of the best books in the series., Pros \\n Harry is very mature but is also flawed, wounded, and paranoid \\n Voldemort\\'s backstory is significantly fleshed out \\n Relationship and parallels between Harry and Voldemort are expanded even more \\n Hermione and Ron\\'s colorful relationship grows more mature \\n Harry finally falls for Ginny \\n Tightly pace throughout \\n Smaller character arcs and stories help fill up story \\n Dumbledore is very involved \\n Malfoy\\'s character is further complicated \\n One of the most memorable finales ever \\n Cons \\n Harry and Ginny gets very little time to actually have a relationship \\n The Half Blood Prince subplot doesn\\'t feel that significant, especially considering it\\'s in the name of the book. \\n AMAZING., This book was the first Harry Potter book that I read. Not because I didn\\'t like the movies before, but I never really understood why everyone liked to read back then. So when I started reading the half blood prince, I was pretty amazed with how I was thrown into the book, and how much I loved they way she wrote it. The Halfblood prince, is one of the best books I\\'ve ever read, it had everything a great book should have. \\n I kept trying to guess who the halfblood prince was, and it was nice to get to know Voldemorts childhood. I also loved how much quidditch there was in this book. So of course I give this book the ultimate 5 stars., I love going through the Harry Potter books again and again. This one is one of the best in cases of intrigue and plot. Such a well written, well told story., ** spoiler alert ** \\n So much of me does not want the Harry Potter series to end - there are still many unanswered questions, unknown characters to meet, and plot lines/perspectives to understand. Nevertheless, as Hagrid notes, too much a good thing can in turn be bad. I\\'ve found myself spending hours on end just trying to get to the next chapter, find out what happens or even race to finish the book so I can watch the movie. I can say that reading good books (particularly the Harry Potter series) has become by far, my favorite way to use my time. I suppose that once I finish the books, I\\'ll be back to my old self and focusing on what needs to take place in my life, rather than what occurs in Harry\\'s. \\n While not my favorite book, I had a difficult time putting down the next installment of the Harry Potter series, book 6 - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. This is the book I knew least about, having not seen the movie nor read the book prior - the only information I knew was based on seeing the second half of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows. While the movie did help to explain some of the concepts in the book, I do think that if I had not seen the movie, the book may have been a bit better. My favorite part of the book, on the other hand, is the immense amount of history packed into the book. \\n Prior to this book, we know little of Voldemort - he is the second greatest wizard of all time, he killed Harry Potter\\'s parents, and he wants to live forever and rule all the wizarding world. In a sense, the prior books portrayed him not as man, but as indestructable, inhuman and invisible, except for the fact that Harry Potter could not be destroyed by him. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, however, helps us to understand Voldemort the boy, Voldemort the man, and eventually Voldemort the power-hungry wizard. I find myself feeling somewhat sympathetic for Voldemort the child, unwanted by his father, left parent-less by his mother, and having the blood of Slytherin coursing through his vains. In a way, this book was more about Slytherin than it was Voldemort. I struggle that we know little of the history of the other houses, but know of the immense evil of Slytherin. Nonetheless, it is in this book that Dumbledore helps Harry Potter better understand the weaknesses of the one who is bound to kill him, and also we see the rise of Draco Malfoy. On a side note, my heart feels for Draco. Spoiled by his parents, insecure, wants to be respected and revered but only achieves that through bullying and intimidation (which in a sense is not respect or reverence at all), confused - Draco Malfoy is not the killer that he desires to become. He has been ingrained with the concept that power will lead to happiness, but in the end Draco struggles to carry out the necessary steps by which to achieve such power - maybe because he doesn\\'t want to. How often do we put such expectations on our children, and blind them to what will truly make them happy because of our insecurity as parents and adults? \\n This book has the wildest (yet somewhat anticipated) turns in any of the Harry Potter series (as of yet, I haven\\'t read the final installment). Throughout the books, you constantly hear characters comment about Dumbeldore, suggesting that as long as Dumbledore is still around, no one can fear. As a reader, it was obvious to see that Dumbledore must meet his end, not only because the book suggests it, but even moreso because he must step out of the way for Harry to complete his destiny. What a concept - it is our duty as adults to step aside so that our children can grow, experience, and take action. It makes me wonder, for myself, how long I have allowed adults to take the blow for me while I cowered behind them, not wanting to feel the pain that is inevitable. How many times have I tried to step in the way of a child\\'s growth in order to prevent pain, but rather preventing their own evolvement? Even in the book, Harry is quick to tell Dumbledore that if he can avoid the pain (having experienced it before), he would rather take that course. But deep down, Harry knows that if he chooses the path that avoids the inevitable, then he in turn will turn his back on the truth and on himself. It\\'s true that without pain there is no gain - and yet pain is what we most want to avoid. What a struggle. \\n The philosophically complex, yet simple, truth about love that Dumbledore tries to portray in this book was difficult to follow, and perhaps that is because LOVE is taken for granted. My biggest complaint about the book is how everything that was once magical, amazing and exciting is now second-nature. I loved how Harry responded to owls delivering mail, brooms that could fly and wands that could make things appear out of thin air as he did in the first installment, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone. In this book, these out-of-this-world ideas are old hat, expected. Maybe that is in a sense how we view love - old hat, expected. Dumbledore further explains to Harry that Voldemort is without such love, and that love apparently is the most powerful of all \\'old magic\\'. In an attempt to make himself immortal, all-powerful and invisible, Voldemort splits his soul by murdering innocent lives. With every death comes more damage to the soul. The hidden message in that is powerful - with every life one takes it becomes \\'easier\\', you become less human, you are overcome with the thirst for power and what better way to gain that than control over another. Such a concept gave a bit of tangible to intangible - hats off to you J.K. Rowling. And while Harry continues to struggle with his own thirst for revenge, his thirst is quieted by his own mother\\'s love. (You hear little more about James Potter, except that he was kind of a jerk. The mention of Lily Potter over and over shows that J.K. Rowling is more concerned with the sacrifices of the mother - maybe because she herself was a single mom... my own speculation.) I would say that this was my most pertinent \\'take-away\\' of the book - that love is by far the most powerful, underestimated and underappreciated gift that we can share with others, and its power to change the outcome of even the direst of situations is phenomenal, if we only choose love over evil. \\n The shock of an apparent bad, turned good, turned bad again Professor Snape is disheartening; I\\'ve liked Snape from the first book, and even moreso since he taught Harry Potter the power of controlling your emotions through Occlumency (HUGE life lesson for me there!). How wonderful that in a sense, this book was about him, and that Harry esteemed him without even knowing it! It goes to show, that when a prejudice is involved, we may have a tendency to miss out on some of the greatest life lessons and knowledge, simply because we do not want to hear what that person has to say. I know that Snape will be vindicated in the next book. He is my favorite character, and to see how he sacrificed himself and his own happiness for the greater good is a testament to me. Goodness, it\\'s as if he is a real person - and I\\'ve been viewing the whole series through a Pensieve. \\n Excellent book, though I think the movie might have been better, despite its inaccuracies. \\n \"Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.\" \\n ~Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince \\n \"And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\" \\n ~Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince \\n \"We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.\" \\n ~Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince \\n \"Of course not, Harry! Don\\'t you see? Voldemore himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of tghem realize that, one day, amongst their victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\" \\n ~Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince \\n \"\\'DON\\'T -\\' screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them - \\n \\'CALL ME COWARD!\\'\" \\n ~Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince \\n \"But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew -- and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents -- that there was all the difference in the world. \" \\n ~Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Possibly my favorite book in the series. I kind of knew it all along, even if I didn\\'t want to believe it., Nolur seri bitmesin nolur diyr kivraniyorum.., gotta love some snape lol, Probably my favorite book of the series so far -- it edged out Azkaban by a bit. The exposition in this wasn\\'t as annoying as the last two, and the way it was delivered seemed slightly more natural than before. I was crying through the last two chapters, and found everything incredibly emotional -- Dumbldore\\'s death, Fleur\\'s reaction to Bill, Tonks and Lupin, Hagrid in mourning, Harry saying he couldn\\'t see Ginny any longer...it was all very sincere. Great book., what a tear jerker that ending was, I love theses books so mush., re-read again. Love the Harry Potter books., Best book of the series. Definitely has the most amount of stuff that was sorely missed in the film adaptation. Such a great read., oh...my...god \\n also, draco is still my baby. no one will tell me otherwise., There are really no words for everything that this book brings to the table. It has so many exciting moments, but also, what I feel, is one of the most heart wrenching moments of the entire series. This was this very first HP book I listened to, and I must say Jim Dale is a delight to listen to and really brought the story to life!, I used to read Harry Potter 1-4 over and over until the 5th book came out. I love the series. First series i\\'ve read and became devoted to., Fast pace , Exciting and revealing . \\n Amazing one ., Reread for the 9th time July 2013. My absolute favourite series, my childhood. Words cannot describe how much Harry Potter means to me., OK--really 4 and 1/2. I love the Harry Potter books and really look forward to the last one. I\"m hoping that Snape\\'s character is redeemed. I really have thought that the way Rowling portrays Snape and how Harry might be wrong in his perceptions of him (and people he simply dislikes) is quite clever and nuanced--I\\'ll be disappointed if he is just a villain after all. (I\\'ll certainly see soon.), This book wasn\\'t as \"fun\" as GOBLET. It was nearing the end of the series and things were really heating up. The kids were older, too, which is fine, and the material reflected the increased age and maturity. It deepened the controversy surrounding Snape as well, ratcheting up what was already a hotly contested issue., This book is one of my favorite in the HP series. we see the inner teen of harry coming out. we see romance, jealousy, anger and all other emotions teenagers feel at 16. This book is also where things start to make sense. it puts things in a totally different perspective to read about voldemort as a child and teenager. it makes you really realize that everyone was once a child and a learner. all experts were once beginners. even though tom riddle was bad from the beginning, it all had to start somewhere. This is only the introduction to the true battle and the most epic adventure ever!! j.k rowling is genius and all these books are incredible., The first time I read this novel I got to the yearly trip to Diagon Alley where I read \"Why are you worrying about You-Know-Who? You should be worrying about U-No-Poo--The constipation sensation that\\'s gripping the nation!\" Laughter overtook me. I had to pause my reading for a bit just to fully appreciate the brilliance of Fred and George. \\n The rest of the novel is equally brilliant with so many details about Voldemort/Tom Riddle exposed. The wonderfully ingenious pensieve is introduced here. Wish I could have a pensieve to carefully document and sift through my memories. Rowling also explains the Horcrux, another fantastic idea/plot device that she\\'s set up well in previous novels. \\n The chase is truly on. Voldemort is back. Dumbledore is stepping up his involvement in Harry\\'s life. Harry begins to see some information much more clearly. He\\'s piecing together how he must defeat Voldemort. By the end of this novel, he\\'s not sure if he\\'s ready for the final part of his quest. However, he realizes that his readiness is not really relevant. And I love that message that I loosely translate to \"Suck it up and get it done.\", This is absolutely my favourite part of saga. They are still in school, but you can feel the difference between previous books and you can feel the changes, which coming., Part 6, Rating: 3.5 out of 5 \\n In my opinion, the weakest book of the series., Every few years I return to Harry and his friends by page, and I am never disappointed. This series was the first series I ever felt invested in as a child and that feeling of attachment has only grown over the years, as my ability to access and understand literature has also grown. In the Half-Blood Prince, Harry learns the truth about Voldemort\\'s immortality and believes that he learns the truth about Snape\\'s loyalty. Simultaneously, he realizes what his future must mean and prepares himself to set off on the dark journey ahead of him. Half-Blood is an integral and entertaining piece of Harry\\'s story, and I would be lying if I said I could get through it with out tears stemming from every emotion I\\'ve ever felt as a reader., Dumbledore\\'s death and the aftermath = me sobbing until I can\\'t breathe. \\n Such a wonderful precursor to the climax of the series, and a powerful motivator for Harry to finish off Voldemort once and for all. \\n Hermione pissed me off more than usual in this book, but that\\'s neither here nor there., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I read this book almost entirely in a day, I think it\\'s safe so say I\\'ve been drawn into the series! \\n First of all - I didn\\'t write a review for the Order of the Pheonix as I was too anxious to start on the Half Blood Prince. I did enjoy it but I must admit I wasn\\'t sure about Sirius\\' death at the end of the book. It comes out of the blue and ends quite unceremoniously. There isn\\'t a body for a funeral or for Harry to mourn, and so I think it leaves the reader feeling quite dissatisfied. The only thing I can think is that he somehow comes back. He did go through the curtain after all, perhaps Harry was right in thinking people can come back. It surprises me that he never strives to find out what the archway is before accepting Sirius\\' death. \\n Anyway, onto the Half Blood Prince. It is named after Severus Snape, although you don\\'t learn that until the end of the book. I had my suspicions, but Rowling diverted us from the truth with the false clue that the book is 50 years old and was owned by a woman. It\\'s not until Hermione realises the woman was Snape\\'s mother that we learn the truth. \\n I can\\'t quite make my mind up about this book. There are many twists and turns. Seeing into Voldermort\\'s past is fascinating, and with it you see that Dumbledore had many occasions to stop Tom Riddle, and yet his desire to let the boy change on his own stopped him. Why didn\\'t he warn the staff of his behaviour in the orphanage? I know that Dumbledore is the kind of person who wants to see good, and who wants people to reform on their own steam, but surely he would have warned someone of Riddle\\'s behaviour as he watches Tom become more and more popular amongst Hogwarts staff and students. \\n We see a very different Dumbledore in this book. He is no longer shrewd and powerful, but weak in person and in strength. He admitted in the previous book that he makes mistakes - he cares too much for Harry and lets it cloud his judgement. We see that his judgement can be flawed and I think we also see hints of how Voldermort\\'s murderous rampage has caused regret and guilt in Dumbledore, in that he didn\\'t act sooner. \\n Harry actually takes a bit of a backstep from the spotlight in this book (at least to the reader) because I think the primary concerns are Snape and Malfoy. Both are characters who can be bad, and yet it is uncertain how bad they can be and whether this badness is something that can be saved. There is a very interesting dynamic to the Snape/Malfoy storyline. We\\'re made to think that Snape is double bluffing Voldermort and actually working for Dumbledore. Then, right at the end we see Snape kill Dumbledore without any sign of guilt or regret. We also see that Malfoy cannot kill - I think this is important. Malfoy can still be saved, and Harry has finally seen that his arch-nemesis is little more than a spiteful little boy, rather than the monster Harry sometimes believes him to be. Malfoy has many faults but he\\'s not evil or a murderer. I hope to see him redeem himself in the next book. \\n Now, on to Snape. Dumbledore vouched for Snape and believed him good. At the end we supposedly see Dumbledore begging for his life and Snape cruelly taking it from him. Halfway through the book, Snape and Dumbledore have an argument and Snape wants to back out. We know Dumbledore knows about the Unbreakable Vow and Malfoy. So what I believe is this - Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him in order to save Malfoy from turning bad, and save Snape from death. Dumbledore is probably motivated by the fact that he couldn\\'t save Tom Riddle, yet Malfoy can be stopped from turning into a Voldermort character by not killing. \\n I\\'m not sure whether I would have come to this conclusion if it hadn\\'t been for the fact that I\\'ve got a vibe from HP fans that Snape is good rather than bad. I\\'ve been trying not to find out spoilers but that\\'s pretty difficult when it\\'s the most talked about series of the last decade! I do think the clues are there and Snape is one of the greatest mysteries of the book. He\\'s my favourite character and I want to believe there is good in him, so much good that he is brave enough to look bad and be hated in order to do what he thinks is right. So often I want to see him just sit down and tell Harry what it was like to be bullied by his father, and for Harry to tell him that he isn\\'t the bully his father was... but that would probably be quite a boring book... \\n After book 4 I felt there was too much black and white. Well, as I thought, Rowling has thrown a huge paint pot of grey into the mix. The good are sometimes bad and the bad are sometimes good. The pure bloods are half bloods. It doesn\\'t matter what side you\\'re on or what race you are - you\\'re still human with human strengths and weaknesses. What an amazing message to deliver so well to youth. \\n On to book 7! (after I watch the film. Film 5 wasn\\'t very good so I\\'m hoping this will be better.), Omg all the feels! This was my favorite from the series reread so far!, Now on to the next/last one. Didn\\'t see a particular death coming in this book. Was a bit shocked. Not looking forward to the end of this series; have enjoyed it so., THE best Harry Potter book., Plus de dix ans plus tard et l\\'effet produit reste toujours le meme... J\\'adore particulierement ce tome, sombre, cruel et doux a la fois. Je m\\'extasie toujours de la facilite deconcertante de Rowling pour construire des intrigues labyrinthiques mais fluides, disseminer mille-et-un details insufflant du corps au monde des sorciers, jongler parfaitement entre humour et drame, tendresse et fureur, et mettre en scene des relations humaines puissantes et subtiles. Je respire un grand coup et je me re-plonge dans le dernier tome maintenant., Well, I just finished this about two minutes ago, so forgive me if I fail to string together sentences in a way that makes sense. I have enjoyed this series immensely; I have rated the former three with five stars. I have also rated this one five stars, but I have never been confronted with a stronger desire for there to be six stars. Or ten. Or...a million. \\n This is the best one that I have read thus far in this series, and really, any other series. I know and feel for these characters very deeply, and, therefore, care deeply for the story. But as far as this book goes exclusively, the plot is truly a masterpiece. Harry has matured, and he is able to \"chase\" the mysteries in a more interesting ways. Instead of clues coming to him, he goes out and seeks clues for himself. \\n I finished this book with tears in my eyes. It is beautiful. \\n \"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\", Good book but again, not one of my favorites in the series. I believe this was also the shortest book in the series., I cried. Oh, I cried. Goodness., This was the book that made me stop reading the series. Book #5 should have been the one to finalize my opinion of J.K.\\'s writing, plotting, character development & the overall path in which the story was going. But my curiosity of \"what\\'s going to happen?\" got the best of me & I dove into this one thinking: \"Maybe it\\'ll get better?\" I was wrong. It got worse. The total overuse of flashbacks really started to annoy me & for the number of pages the book has, Rowling needed to avoid keeping stuff totally hidden behind curtain #3. In other words, stop hiding everything in order to get people to buy your next book--you can reveal some aspects while keeping others wrapped in the enigma--don\\'t worry J.K., we\\'ve throw our chips into the pot & are in for the long haul. But due to her lack of revealing, she just frustrated me to the point I said: \"Enough! I have better books to read--especially in the fantasy epics department.\" I also hated she abandoned the plot device of Harry going to school--Hogwarts was completely cut out of the series & just became a setting/backdrop to be used when needed. Harry becomes a kind of \"Wizard School Drop-out\" & it really harms the story in my opinion. Or is it that Harry is such a great wizard that he doesn\\'t need any more education? Bull. He pretty much cheats his way through classes--Tom\\'s Potion book anyone?--& really comes off as a lazy wizard/jock who\\'d rather play Quiddich than learn the important secrets of becoming a wizard. & then there\\'s the brooding crap of: \"Nobody understands me\" & \"I\\'m so alone in my misery\" & \"why did my parents die?\" What crap! He has so many people around him that love him he kind of just spits on it. What an ass! & don\\'t give me that: \"He\\'s being a typical teenager\" garbage! He\\'s a wizard for crying out loud! It\\'s like being a member of the X-Men! Get over it! That\\'s it! I\\'m done with this series even though I\\'m one book away from finishing it. I\\'ve got better things to read & to do with my time., This book, too, I pre-ordered from Amazon, and received the day it arrived in bookstores. Wonderful continuation of the series. I found the book to be a great next installment, and I have enjoyed the new twists to the plot and unexpected things that happened. I really appreciated the peeks into Voldemort\\'s history and growing up that the memories and flashbacks provide. It also becomes more and more apparent that Harry and Lord Voldemort\\'s upbringing are so similar., I just physically can\\'t keep going. My body has cried too much and I feel empty inside. Why does this always have to happen to me., Still mourning the loss of Dumbledore...I don\\'t think I could put together a good review because I\\'m too depressed...I guess that tells you how connected you become to the characters?, Where Severus puts it all on the line, and then crosses it. \\n January 2013 ooooh! We find out so much backstory here, I have a first edition of this book. I got it for my ninth birthday. The Horcruxe part I found a bit scary to read. Now, about ten years later, it still creepes me out a bit. I love the Ron and Hermione drama. The ending is sad(why J.K Rowling, why?). When I did not know yet that Snape had been ordered to kill Dumbledore from Dumbledore, I was so mad., A very good book!! I love how Rowling understands that life isn\\'t always Happily Ever After., Ugh, my heart hurts, Oh, it\\'s brilliantly written but also heartbreaking, that\\'s the right word. \\n Though, I have a feeling that Harry will return to Hogwarts (or so I hope). \\n I\\'m still kinda upset, though. \\n SNAPE???? WHAT THE FRIGGIN\\' HECK. I mean it\\'s weird that he would be someone\\'s favorite, but I thought it was all play and pretense when he promised to be loyal to He-Who-Has-No-Nose, MAGNIFICENT., OMG, A lot of people I know (especially my mother) complained about this book, but I liked it. It was certainly an improvement over the fifth book. I thought the development of Snape\\'s character was interesting even if J.K. Rowling didn\\'t take it in the direction I wanted, not that my opinion about it matters., I have nothing to say, my heart, my poor heart I can\\'t, Dumbledore *crying an ocean*, Harry Potter and The Young Adult NovelWell the more I read through the end of HP the more I realise how cool it would\\'ve been to read the books blind but sadly that isn\\'t the case. The case is that I know the plot which allows me to bitch about stupid shit in it like the fact that for 500 pages this book is nothing short of a rehashed previous book and a stupid romance novel (Yes I do call it stupid because Luna didn\\'t get a love story, shut up). Some chapters I had to force myself through and at the end found were completely unneeded plotwise. Plot, as stated, is pretty much the generic HP plot from the previous 4 books with the exception of Goblet of Fire which did something different for a change. Bad qualities aside the last bits of the book are still quite powerful even though I don\\'t care much about that gay wizard (used in both possible ways). People die in a children\\'s book, Luna Lovegood is in it but Harry still doesn\\'t love her so 4 outta\\' 5 it is again., I was half way reading the book and I really, really wanted to watch the trailer so I watched it, and, it was brilliant. This is the best book in the series and it is a MUST read., ** spoiler alert ** \\n This is my new favorite Harry Potter book, despite the fact that the ending was the absolute worst. I loved all the backstory on Tom Riddle, but oh so desperately wanted Dumbledore to live. I knew Draco couldn\\'t do it but I was so unbelievably angry when Snap came in to kill Dumbledore. Everything in the past hundred pages made me so angry, yet I loved every bit of this book. \\n During the book, I wasn\\'t racking my brain trying to figure out how it would end or what plot twist would come next, so that made reading it so much more fun since I wasn\\'t stressing out. But one thing I did think about was the identity of the Half Blood Prince. I was convinced for some reason that it was Voldemort and was shocked when Snape was revealed to be the owner of the book. \\n Hopefully the last book will be even better but I can\\'t start reading it yet because this book deserves the proper mourning period after being finished., FAVORITE SERIES OF ALL TIME!, I have no words. I am dead. *leaves to sob for hours*, Hmm, how to put my feelings into words. Since so many people have read the books, I tried to stay away from reading reviews on Goodreads, and I did (at least for this book). Therefore... I didn\\'t believe Dumbledore actually died until my friend who was also listening to the book with me admitted that he really was truly dead (she\\'s already read the books once). I\\'m so confused whether Snape is a good guy or a bad guy. Dumbledore was so sure he was good, I want to believe that Snape had a good reason for killing Dumbledore. I didn\\'t cry when Dumbledore died (partly because I didn\\'t think he was actually dead and partly because I felt kind of \"meh\" about Dumbledore all along) but I did tear up a little when the phoenix sang his lament. I love that Harry and Ginny got together afterall. And Ron and Hermione... sigh, the tension between them and their actions/reactions because they like each other but don\\'t want to admit it makes me want to shake them! Mostly just Ron though. Gah, Lavender Brown... :P \\n Notes: listened to the audiobook, some swearing, kissing, some deaths/torture/injuries, The sixth book is an amazing set up for book seven. One of the things I like most in the book is the Ron and Hermione sub-plots and having more focus on Hogwarts. The sixth book was the first time I\\'d gone to a midnight release and it was a lot of fun to see so many people together that shared a passion for a work of literature. \\n The fifth book had just come out when I finally decided to pick up this \"kids\" series. I really enjoyed the movies and there was a rumor that Warner Brothers was not going to make any past the third book. I\\'m so glad that the rumor went around because I never would have picked the books up if I thought I could keep watching the movies. \\n Each of these books is so fantastic. JK Rowling is such a master story teller; she just effortlessly weaves the foreshadowing that is found throughout all seven books. There is no doubt that Harry Potter was a pop culture phenomenon, but the difference between these and say Twilight is that my great grandchildren will still be reading Potter. \\n If you\\'ve never read the series you won\\'t be disappointed., Un libro curioso cuanto menos. A pesar de no tener gran accion, el libro aclara el origen del poder de Voldemort. Por fin se sabe por que es tan poderoso el Senor Tenebroso, y por que no murio el dia que fue a por Harry. Un libro que le da una nueva perspectiva a la saga, 4.5 Really enjoyed this one!, En general el libro me ha gustado, pues se ve una evolucion enooorme de los personajes. La mayoria ya son unos adolescentes, y por ello encontramos en la novela toda esa clase de cuestiones que tenemos a esa edad, como las relaciones romanticas, la amistad, las dudas sobre el futuro, sobre que carrera elegir, que camino tomar... y bueno, en general creo que es de los libros de la saga que mas me ha hecho reir, sobre todo por el comportamiento de Ron y Hermione. \\n Uno de los temas centrales de la novela es cuando Harry encuentra un libro de hechizos que es propiedad de \"el principe mestizo\" Harry no sabe quien pueda ser, pero lo utiliza y se da cuenta que los hechizos que vienen en el son muy buenos, aunque algunos son bastante peligrosos. \\n En definitiva un libro que vale la pena leer, pues desvela varios secretos rumbo al final de la saga, donde podemos conocer mejor al mago mas temido del mundo magico, y donde nuestros personajes favoritos, Harry, Ron, Hermione y los demas alumnos lidian con muchas cosas en este sexto ano en Hogwarts., I loved the Half-Blood Prince. There was a mystery solved and an ending that was just...he just... oh, you\\'ll read it and you\\'ll know what I\\'m talking about., Really hate that Rowling decided to \\'kill\\' Dumbledore., (reread), One of the least entertaining but most profound Harry Potters. This is the book where it all begins to come together. While the first 4, maybe even 5 books felt as if they were stand alone this and the 7th bring everything together and make it one overarching story instead of several stand alone book. JK has probably one of the most incredible mind out our generation. \\n Snape and Narcissi make an unbreakable vow that he will protect Draco and assist them on his \"mission\" which we don\\'t find out until the end what exactly that is. \\n For a change of pace Dumbledore picks up Harry to take to the Burrow and in classic Dumbledore well meaning manipulation he uses Harry to persuade Slughorn, a former teacher of Tom Riddle, Harry\\'s parents and company to return to Hogwarts and teach potions (Snape has finally been moved to Defense Against the Dark Arts or Dada, if you will.) \\n Hermione is at the Burrow already and the next day they receive their O.W.L results and a school supply list. At Diagone ally they see Draco entering a Dark Arts supplier, Borgin and Burkes and follow him under the invisibility cloak. Harry becomes sure Droco is a Death Eater. \\n Harry was not going to take potions because he did not receive an outstanding, which he needed to carry on under Snape. However when he returns to school he discovers Snapes promotion and Slughorn will be teaching potions. He has to grab a second hand book that he discovers once belonged to the Half Blood Prince we later learn that the Half Blood Prince was Snapes Mother, snape used the book and recorded all kinds of interesting and helpful spells and potions. For the first time revealing Snape\\'s true brilliance in magic \\n Harry uses the half blood Prince\\'s notes in the potion book which help him to excel in potions making Hermione mad and Slughorn dote on him. Meanwhile Dumbledore is regularly meeting with harry to look into the pensive to see all of the memories of people who have had direct contact with Voldemort. There is one memory from Slughorn that has been tampered and Dumbledore asks Harry to retrieve the real memory, which he does after several false starts his memory shows us explaining what Horcrux are to Riddle and riddles deep interest in them. Dumbledore explains to Harry in order for Voldemort to be killed all the Horcrux (where voldemort split his soul) must be destroyed. Two Horcrux (Riddles Diary and Marvel\\'s ring have already been destroyed. . Harry through this learns about Voldemort\\'s family and his path towards murder and obsession with gaining eternal life. \\n Blah blah teenage relationship drama happens. \\n Near the end of the year Harry and Dumbledore journey to a cave to retrieve a suspected horcrux, Slytherin\\'s locket. The locket is at the bottom of a basin and can only be reached by drinking the potion above it. Dumbledore with Harry\\'s help drink and and Dumbledore becomes very thirsty. When Harry get\\'s him water from the lake Voldemort\\'s Inferi surface and try to kill them. Dumbledore fights them off despite being weakened. When they return to Hogwarts they find the Dark Mark has been placed over the astronomy tower. Dumbledore tells Harry to get snape, they hear a noise and Dumbledore freezes Harry under the invisibility cloak just as Draco disarms Dumbledore and threatens to kill him. What follows is a vaguely amusing conversation between the two where redemption becomes evident and possible. Death Eaters that Draco helped get in arrive and encourage Draco to kill Dumbledore. Snape comes in, Dumbledore pleads with him and Snape kills Dumbledore. Following is another minor battle. Harry finds out the locket is not a real horcrux, it contains a note from someone named R.A.B and Harry announces he will spend next year not a Hogwarts but hunting down Voldemort. \\n I LOVE the theme of redemption here. Draco while a snobby little brat still has goodness in him. I love Dumbledore\\'s responses to Draco\\'s arrogance. Harry starts to grow up and we are left with more questions than answers., favourite book of the series, least favourite film of the series, Wow! How did I miss Harry Potter ten years ago? My quest to read Harry Potter now has been an amazing journey!, With one to go...favorite in the series yet., My personal favorite of the series., One of my favourites by far! I found this pretty easy to read and raced through it whenever I was given the chance to read :), ** spoiler alert ** \\n This book was so amazing. The first time that I read this book it was my favorite Harry Potter book. I loved the character development. It was so much fun to travel into the pensieve. I loved the character Professor Slughorn. I loved his personality and his character made me laugh out loud. It made me go into a fangirl depression when Dumbledore died though. This book was amazing. If anybody would like to discuss this book or has any questions feel free to contact me! :), THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!! Oooooh!!! <3 \\n Honestly I ended up watching all the movies before reading the books (ashamed :( ) but because if that I have been absolutly dying to read the Half Blood Prince. It\\'s my favorite HP movie, ergo my favorite book! I\\'m a bit of an odd one I guess, liking the 6th book over the 7th, but I can\\'t help it :) \\n Draco\\'s in this book more. It seems to be about him and his struggles as well as Harry. I love that because it shows that he has things going on as well and that... I think it\\'s hard for him even being the little rich Slytherin. In the earlier books he was just a little--Draco I\\'m sorry D:-- shit. Ruder and meaner than in thr movies. If y\\'all haven\\'t figure it out by now.... I love Draco/Tom. He\\'s my favoriteist character&actor! :3 \\n J.K.Rowling is just fabulous, if you haven\\'t read the Harry Potter books... SHAME ON YOU! Go do it now!!, I cried ._. \\n And I feel betrayed haha., \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do. Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that one day amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them, and strikes back.\" - Dumbledore \\n This may be a quote from a YA fantasy novel, but I don\\'t think society will ever truly grasp this. We seem to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. \\n So many twists and turns, and a lot of heartache and betrayal in this one. [?], Ca reste de loin mon prefere !, This was my favorite Harry Potter book besides The Prisoner of Azkaban. I read it in a couple days when I was in 11th grade. I literally couldn\\'t get my head out of it. There were a lot of twists and turns and I loved how Rowling portrayed looking back into memories of young Voldemort. This book had a different flavor than the others for sure., It was so sad.. it made me cry when Dumbledore died, just means that it\\'s a really \\n good book, because I formed a close connection with the characters.. \\n :)Another achievement to be credited to J.K. Rowling., Soyleyecek soz bulamiyorum.., Oh my poor heart, falling apart, the deaths are happening now....., Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince might be the best of the series. The characters begin their tentative awakening into adulthood. The shape of the world broadens, deepens, and assumes greater complexity. Personalities are immediately present, organically evolved from tropes and traits. Best of all the book ends well. Among hundreds of stories, HBP stands among maybe a dozen that satisfy. I could stop with this book. Could, but won\\'t., This one is my favorite leg of the journey so far!, NOT READY FOR IT TO END, \"Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\" \\n OKAY this was so much better than the last book (book 5)!!!! These characters are just so lovely and charming! Ron Weasley was hilarious, I have always loved Hagrid and I really enjoyed that Dumbledore played a large part in this book! My plan to is to finish this series before the year is up!, This is the one book in the series that I always think I like the least, only to reread it and discover that I love it just as much as the others. I also always find it remarkable how these three teenagers are immediately prepared to take on just immense responsibility. How Ron and Hermione just so readily agree to drop everything and go with Harry. I think throughout the series we see snippets of Ron and Hermione\\'s strength, Hermione specifically, but this is the point we realize that in their own ways they\\'re just as strong as Harry. One thing that did always bother me with this book is how anticlimactic the cavern scene always seemed to be. I suppose that could be explained due to Dumbledore\\'s death and the fighting at Hogwarts during his death, as well as the fact the \"Horcrux\" is actually a fake, but I\\'ve always just wanted a little more from that scene. Even the fighting sort of seemed anticlimactic as it is told second hand to the reader, but ah well. I do think this book and the final chapter is but a taste of the sadness that is to come in the final original series., I was in tears. Just sobbing and sobbing for like 5 hours straight. I finished it at like 12pm which wasn\\'t so bad but then i curled up with it and cried. I was so heart broken but i love this book so much., Series as a whole: 4-5 stars., F***! Dumbledore!, SUCH AN AMAZING REREAD. \\n I cried for an hour., I want to write a book about how much I love this book., Book Ginny! Enough said..., My absolute favorite book :), Someone Very Important to Hogwarts died!!!! Harry potter loses his Mentor.......This book made me cry! It really teaches us a great lesson on love and explains the temporary nature of things....Like every other potter book you just don\\'t want to finish this book but this time there was no HAPPY ENDING! And yes Hogwarts will not be the SAME again.... \\n The potterheads will never forget the curse \\'Avada Kedavra\\' , at least I won\\'t! \\n J.K Rowling charted Potters Sixth Hogwarts Year with an unmatchable set of skills....Simply loved the book! A must read like all other Potter books, I\\'d forgotten how much I love this book!, Makes for wonderful bedtime reading to the kids. :), I read this when it first came out 8 years ago, but luckily for me, I forgot 99% of what happened so it was almost like reading it for the first time. \\n And the only reason I remembered who killed Dumbledore was because Sideshow Bob mentioned it in an episode of The Simpsons., Ugh. I am almost through this series. I did sort of enjoy this one. The story progressed and Harry Potter seemed less idiotic. While I maintain that I do not care for these books, I do see their appeal. JK Rowling does create a rather complete and intricate world that I do admire. I just feel like the story takes entirely too long to pan out since each book has to cover a whole stupid school year!, Todavia estoy intentando recuperarme de ese final. \\n En este libro me gusto mucho mas Harry, esta mas maduro y decidido, ademas de que senti que crecio a lo largo de esta historia. \\n Pasan muchas cosas, demasiadas y hay muchisimo informacion. Me encanto, \"I\\'m not worried, Harry, I\\'m with you.\" \\n Hands down, the best line in the whole series. \\n This might be one of my favorite in the septology., J.K Rowling will never fail to amaze me. This book had me sobbing at 2:00 AM for the death of a beloved one and of anger for someone who had me shaken by betrayal. This is definitely my favourite book in Mrs.Rowling\\'s Harry Potter series along with one of my favorite books of all time. I keep gaining more and more respect for Rowling with each book; I recommend this to everyone. 10/10 :)., I loved the fun, make believe world that J.K. Rowling creates and I do enjoy her writing style., THIS WAS THE 4TH BEST BOOK..., Finally! I have managed to read it cover to cover. Whew! \\n The story did not make me pass through a sentence, a paragraph or a page. I went through all of it. I will never get tired of reading this series over and over if I have to. I shed manly tears on the last few chapters because of its awesomeness and magic and the intensity of my imagination. Haha! \\n Definitely a Potterhead, always and forever. :), Reread again. Still enjoying my reread of the books. The end is near!, I can not stop crying over this ending and although I know what happens at the end, \\'cause i\\'ve already saw the movies since they where released i can\\'t wait to start the last book. \\n P.s. Thank you JK Rowling for creating Hermione., low-key killing me, I absolutely loved it! Who is the Half-blood Prince? Suspenseful, riveting, CAN I JUST SAY THAT I AM CRYING RIGHT NOW AND THAT THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK I CANNOT SLEEP RIGHT NOW PLS JUST BRING ME TISSUES BC I HAVE A LOT OF EMOTIONAL ISSUES RIGHT NOW OMG OMG OMG, More into Voldemort\\'s past which is exciting and terrifying at the same time. Also leading more towards the end of the series and has great suspense., So, going into my re-read of Half-Blood Prince, I actually expected this to get bumped up to 5 stars. \\n It\\'s not. It\\'s staying 4. \\n For whatever reason, more than any other book in the series, I built this one up in my head as having been way better than I remembered it being. I thought the reveal of who the Prince was had more impact than it actually did, but really...it had about as much impact as in the movie. \\n I will stand by the fact that the book version of Half-Blood Prince is much more fleshed out than the movie version, and in that sense is much better. I had forgotten just how hell-bent Harry is on finding Malfoy out and proving he\\'s up to something. What is interested about this book compared to others is the fact that he\\'s actually completely right. Or, mostly completely. And yet, everyone thinks he just hates Malfoy and is going a little overboard. More than any other book in the series, Harry is sort of right on with what he believes is going on, but even his closest friends just don\\'t believe him. They\\'ll indulge him by listening, but clearly aren\\'t buying into Harry\\'s theories. \\n Anyway...I\\'ll get away from that for a bit. One of the bright points of this book, for me, was Harry and Ginny coming together. I forgot that part of the storyline (probably because it was pretty much absent from the book), and how they came together. It was sweet, and a nice respite for both Harry and the reader in the midst of very bad things clearly brewing in the world around them. \\n I\\'m not going to say I hated re-reading this one, but I will say it was one of the bigger disappointments of the re-read for me. In my mind, I recollected more...happening?....than actually did. I think part of this is knowing the crucial role Snape plays in this book, and also knowing about the reveal in book 7. In my mind, I combined events from books 5 and 7 and thought more of them actually happened in book 6. So, basically, it\\'s all my fault this one was a disappointment. \\n One more book to go!, I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH, BUT DEAR LORD MY HEART IS BREAKING!!!!!!! I got to chapter 27, and then I just started screaming \"I\\'M NOT READY!!!!\" And then....it happened. And guess what...I WASN\\'T READY!!!! No matter how many times I read or watch it, I still can\\'t handle it. Now it\\'s time to move onto Deathly Hallows, and I\\'m just not prepared to go back into it again. Pray for my heart!, Another great Harry Potter book and it\\'s still going strong after six books in. This book is a little bit darker than the first five books, which I like. The ending is very sad and so good. It made me feel a lot of emotions for just being a book. \\n I would recommend these series of books to anybody., After the previous installments, I remember this book felt a bit underwhelming on my first read--a prologue to the real action in Deathly Hallows. Now, however, I think this is actually an improvement over the previous entry on the series. \\n After the lack of a solvable central mystery in Order of the Phoenix, I\\'m very happy to see that Half-Blood Prince is meticulously plotted again, which three more or less separate mysteries converging throughout the novel: the nature of Malfoy\\'s plans, the mystery of the Half-Blood Prince\\'s spellbook, and the flashbacks into Voldemort\\'s past as we begin to understand the key to his immortality and possible defeat. We also get to spend a lot of time with Dumbledore, which is great, especially on the third chapter, when he arrives at the Dursley\\'s house. I also really liked the character of Horace Slughorn, a somewhat morally grey dude who\\'s still the most decent person I\\'ve seen come out of Slytherin. \\n To be honest, I do still think that from Goblet of Fire onwards all these novels could have done with some trimming. Just cutting out all the repetition meant to make sure the reader can\\'t forget anything would be helpful., I just this minute finished HBP and all I can say is \"what the fuck was that?\". It takes a lot for me to dislike a book so much to take me from the realm of indifference and mild annoyance and push me into the realm of seething hatred but the thousand-plus pages of tripe (#5-6) I\\'ve forced myself through the past two days has done it. It\\'s as though she was okay with putting out four reasonably well thought out and decently executed populist childrens book and then suffered from what I can only describe as a \"Axl\" - it got to the point people would buy any crap she shat out and just stopped trying. \\n In the past two books the two most important people to our protagonist have died under horrific circumstances and I do not care enough about them to be able to force any kind of emotion either way. The most I can venture is that I\\'m sad it was not Harry himself who was killed so that the books might have fucking ended. \\n And now, if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'m going to go and burn a library or two. See ya., Ah this book. I still remember being in COMPLETE DENIAL about Dumbledore\\'s death at the end of this book. I religiously followed dumbledoreisnotdead.com, and I am convinced to this day that J.K. Rowling was planning on having Dumbledore still be alive but when she saw that website said, \"JK (teehee), he\\'s going to really be dead.\" \\n Actually, to be fair, after this reading, and now that I\\'m reading book 7 again, I do think she actually intended on him dying. But my 16-year-old heart just couldn\\'t take the fact that Dumbledore could really be dead., 1-Why so dramatic ???? \\n 2-Why so silly love stories ???? \\n 3-why this amazing series was spoiled for me ?????? :( :( :(, Si en la orden del Fenix, era la etapa de aceptacion, esta la etapa del panico, la paranoia para con el regreso del que no debe ser nombrado., Appunto per me: darci una terza rilettura appena possibile., I enjoyed this book, but I feel like it doesn\\'t stand well on its own -- it\\'s all to set up book 7., dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~ so sad dY~z, In my opinion, the best book of the series, Amo esta saga. Siempre la amare. El libro tiene el perfecto numero de paginas que una novela debe tener y es perfecto desde la portada. Me parece que si eres un potterhead el miedo a terminar la saga y la nostalgia van a jugar en tu contra al leerla pero Rowling hace muy bien lo que hace, la historia esta llena de magia, sorpresas y emociones como montana rusa. Termina cerrando a la perfeccion ciclos romanticos o mortales, aunque como en muchas historias finales de sagas siempre hay cosillas que nadie se explica excepto la autora, resulta que Rowling hizo una geometria perfecta donde todos los angulos encajan, ademas hay una historia dentro del libro digamos alterna a Harry Potter que te lleva a adentrarte aun mas a su mundo ( si eso es posible ). Me encantaron los detalles romanticos que por supuesto no son muchos ( no es una novela romantica ) hay muertes inesperadas ( por supuesto) y se le hace justicia al mejor heroe tragico de todos ademas, hay un extra donde la nostalgia de los potterheads fue retribuida y al final del dia es Harry Potter, el libro no puede ser malo pero, desde mi punto de vista este final necesitaba mas corazon de parte de la autora y un final mas arriesgado o al menos mas sentimental donde tu corazon de mago o bruja la se llenara de alegria literaria y no ese sentimiento de querer algo mas de este libro, Tears were shed while reading this one. \\n RIP Dumbledore!, All the feeeeels in this book. Mind blown, FAIR WARNING! \\n My review is comprised of Quotes from the book and POSSIBLE commentary by me. If you do not want any spoilers and quotes please do not read past the spoiler warning picture. Enjoy, Stay safe, Have fun! Thanks DG. \\n Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. \"Of course they were,\" he said. \"Surely you\\'ve realized what\\'s going on?\" \"I . . \" hesitated the Prime Minister. It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudge\\'s visits so much. He was, after all, the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy - Muggle Prime Minister \\n *Pats shoulder reassuringly* Not to worry mintier. I think Fudge has soul shares on the ignorant department *Grr* I still can\\'t believe the audacity of Fudge, I really cant. \\n \"I\\'ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, but he won\\'t budge. If he\\'d just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still be . . Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.\" - Cornelius Fudge \\n *Snarls* Oh no! Oh hell No! *Glares* I REALLY don\\'t believe this idiot thinks he could still be considered for the position! \\n \"Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn\\'t --\" \"There is nothing I wouldn\\'t do anymore!\" Narcissa breathed - Bellatrix/Narcissa \\n Heh! Heh! If there is ONE thing Bellatrix will NEVER understand . . It\\'s the love a mother has for her children. Good to see Narcissa FINALLY waking up, though a little too late but still *Shrugs* \\n Snape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door. There was a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs. \\n Oh man, I really despise this sniveling sneak of a character. How appropriate that his Animagus form is a rat! \\n \"Because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance for Lucius\\'s mistake, I know it\" - Narcissa \\n Pride and loyalty can make fools of us all Narcissa *Sigh* I know I should feel bad for the Malfoy\\'s, but I don\\'t. Their idiocy and prejudices landed ALL of them in this damnable situation in the first place, so on their heads be it. \\n \"You should be proud!\" said Bellatrix ruthlessly. \"If I had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!\" - Bellatrix \\n *Snort* Puh-Lease! easy to say when you\\'re childless! Scary thing is though, I honestly think she means it! I wonder why Bellatrix didn\\'t try for children with her husband. Mayhaps waiting for Voldemort to pop the question? *Snickers* \\n \"Aren\\'t you listening, Narcissa? Oh, he\\'ll try, I\\'m sure . . The usual empty words, the usual slithering out of action . . oh, on the Dark Lord\\'s orders, of course!\" - Bellatrix \\n Heh! Heh! Bellatrix has a point. Snape is VERY slippery and VERY persuasive. One of the most convincing \"Bad\" characters. \\n \"Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly. \"However, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house - Dumbledore \\n *Laughs* Good lord, I love Dumbledore! Such a fun sense of humor. And I love the \"Will And Wont\" chapter. \\n \"I don\\'t mean to be rude --\" he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable. \"-- yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,\" Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. \"Best to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia.\" - Vernon/Dumbledore \\n Bah Humbug! I have no idea, why in the hell of it, the Dursley\\'s even bother! They are rude, horrible and I guess as prejudicial as some in the magical world and muggle world can be. *Chuckles* Dumbledore really does own this chapter. \\n The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself. \\n *Roars with laughter* You gotta admit Dumbledore has a wicked sense of humor! Kind of think the Dursleys deserve more than a whack upside their heads with mead. Kind of like having the WHY behind Harry\\'s stay at Privet Drive. Kind of agree with Harry you really want to throttle the house elf Kreacher. I still can\\'t get over the fact Vernon was still a greedy git when Dumbledore mentioned Grimmauld Place. \\n The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.\" Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them - Dumbledore \\n *Shrieks* HOW CAN YOU BE SO DAMN BLIND! *Grr* these damn characters really crank my nerves. \\n \"It is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pure-blood.\" - Dumbledore \\n QUESTION: I thought Harry was a Pure-Blood! \\n \"The Dark Mark,\" he muttered. \"Knew there was something . . ah well - Horace \\n QUESTION: How would Horace know HOW to cast the dark mark? \\n \"Mollywobbles,\" whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door - Molly \\n *Laughs* Aww how cute Arthur and Molly are even in troubled times *Smiles* How awkward for Harry though *Grins* \\n \"Don\\'t you get used to her if she\\'s staying in the same house?\" Harry asked. \"Well, you do,\" said Ron, \"but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then . . \" \\n *Grins* Poor Ron, still afflicted by Fleur. Harry jumping to Fleur\\'s defense doesn\\'t help his cause. *Chuckles* Boys, Boys. They have a lot to learn. I actually think it\\'s rich of Hermione and Ginny snapping at Ron and Harry when they\\'re BOTH unwilling to pursue a relationship with either guys at this point. \\n Bill, who would be staying at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and Ginny\\'s pleasure), passed a full money bag across the table to Harry. \\n QUESTION: How in the hell of it did Bill get access to Harry\\'s account! \\n Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur\\'s feet. \\n *Snickers* Gotta hand it to Ginny! That was funny! Poor Ron ever the blundering buffoon when it comes to Fleur. \\n \"Well, maybe,\" said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr. Weasley was humoring him - Arthur \\n FOR FUCK SAKES! Will these people NEVER learn! Harry and Dumbledore have spent the past YEAR alerting the public to Voldemorts return. Yet he comes to them with suspicions about Draco and he\\'s once again IMMEDIATELY dismissed! *Grr* \\n \"I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!\" - Neville \\n Again, Why the hell not continue with the DA! There is still more to learn and with Dumbledore back in the game it should be even better! Remedial DADA lessons! \\n \"Yeah, Zabini, because you\\'re so talented . . at posing.\" - Ginny \\n *Roars with laughter* Way to go Ginny! She\\'s quite fierce in this book! I like it. \\n \"I was interested to see your new Patronus.\" - Snape \\n QUESTION: What was Tonks original patronus? \\n \"Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly. \"Yes, sir.\" \"There\\'s no need to call me \\'sir,\\' Professor.\" The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying - Snape/Harry \\n \"But you think you\\'re right?\" said Harry. \"Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being -- forgive me -- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.\" - Harry/Dumbledore \\n \"You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look,\" said Ron, shaking back his sleeves. \"And it doesn\\'t hurt that you\\'ve grown about a foot over the summer either,\" Hermione finished, ignoring Ron. \"I\\'m tall,\" said Ron inconsequentially - Ron/Hermione \\n *Chuckles* Poor Ron. He can\\'t seem to catch Hermione\\'s attentions. \\n \"I\\'m a teacher!\" he roared at Harry. \"A teacher, Potter! How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!\" \"I\\'m sorry, sir,\" said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes. Hagrid looked stunned. \"Since when have yeh called me \\'sir\\'?\" \"Since when have you called me \\'Potter\\'?\" \"Oh, very clever,\" growled Hagrid. \"Very amusin\\'. That\\'s me outsmarted, innit? All righ\\', come in then, yeh ungrateful little . .\" - Hagrid/Harry \\n \"And they\\'d love to have me,\" said Harry sarcastically. \"We\\'d be best pals if they didn\\'t keep trying to do me in.\" \\n One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog\\'s Head. \\n Kay, This is the FIRST TIME! I realized DUNG gives Aberforth the mirror shard. Incidentally, WHY does NO ONE Recognize, Mention Aberforth? \\n \"Well, I\\'ll see you all -- OUCH!\" Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. \\n WOW! Harry sounds really agro here! Didn\\'t know he had it in him. \\n \"And Ginny, don\\'t call Ron a prat, you\\'re not the Captain of this team --\" \"Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should -\" - Harry/Ginny \\n A streak of orange light flew under Harry\\'s left arm and missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall. \"Don\\'t be stupid --\" - Harry \\n Ooh, someone\\'s getting protective. Kay, I really like Ginny being all fierce in this book. \\n \"Ginny, where\\'re you going?\" yelled Harry, who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentator\\'s podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring; Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, \"Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.\" - Harry/Ginny \\n He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred so long ago. \\n Or d\\'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I\\'ve always thought there might be something going on between them . .\" \\n QUESTION: So was it EVER CONFIRMED that Madam. Pince and Filch were indeed an item? \\n \"So have you had a good term?\" \"Oh, it\\'s been all right,\" said Luna. \"A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny\\'s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me \\'Loony\\' the other day --\" - Harry/Luna \\n \"What did you have to imitate her for?\" \"She laughed at my mustache!\" \"So did I, it was the stupidest thing I\\'ve ever seen.\" - Harry/Ron \\n Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge. \\n Heh! Heh! You go Hermione! One of the most well played revenge scenes EVER! I think Harry\\'s got the of the female psyche pretty good. \\n Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. \\n I know the rotfang conspiracy is RIDICULOUS and I know Harry isn\\'t the only one to laugh, jeer etc at Luna but that sounds a bit rude and even harsh too me. *Chuckles* I had to laugh at Professor Trelawny being \"Sincerely Interested\" in the rotfang conspiracy, Her and Luna make kindred spirits. \\n \"I know what you\\'re up to! You want to steal my glory!\" There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, \"You are speaking like a child - Malfoy/Snape \\n My sentiments exactly Professor Snape! \\n \"Only time I\\'ve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum. Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.\" - Ron \\n \"But you are normal!\" said Harry fiercely. \"You\\'ve just got a -- a problem --\" Lupin burst out laughing. \"Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my \\'furry little problem\\' in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.\" - Harry/Lupin \\n *Laughs* I honestly still can\\'t believe Harry didn\\'t click to the name Fenrir Greyback, When he heard Malfoy mention it to Borgan. Naturally, I took HERMIONE to put two and two together *Rolls Eyes* \\n \"Dumbledore\\'s man through and through, aren\\'t you, Potter?\" \"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry. \"Glad we straightened that out.\" - Scrimgeour \\n What a powerful statement. I still can\\'t believe the Ministers nerve at asking Harry to play poster boy for the Ministry. *Sigh* They just never get it right do they. \\n \"There is a new password,\" she said. \"And please don\\'t shout.\" \"But we\\'ve been away, how\\'re we supposed to -- ?\" Fat Lady/Ron \\n QUESTION: So a portrait can refuse entry by lying? \\n QUESTION: Who tells the prefects the new password? \\n \"It appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.\" \"He accused me of being \\'Dumbledore\\'s man through and through.\\' \" \"How very rude of him.\" \"I told him I was.\" Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry\\'s intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized that Dumbledore\\'s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knees - Harry/Dumbledore \\n *Sigh* I swear these two are like an old married couple! *Grins* \\n QUESTION: So is Forks tuned into Harry\\'s emotions Or Dumbledore\\'s? Or both? if at all. \\n \"I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfin\\'s release from Azkaban - Dumbledore \\n So why the hell not use Harry\\'s Goblet Of Fire memories to prove Voldemort is back! Harry would\\'ve consented and it would\\'ve verified Everything! Harry and Dumbledore have been preaching about for the past year! \\n Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish. \\n QUESTION: Does apparition etc affect a person over time? \\n \"We were thinking of buying Zonko\\'s,\" said Fred gloomily. \\n QUESTION: Did Fred and George ever buy Zonko\\'s? \\n There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket. Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it. \"Slytherin\\'s mark,\" he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S - Voldemort \\n Oh man. Right here, Right here, is when Harry should\\'ve went \"OMG, I\\'VE SEEN THAT LOCKET!\" Right here, is when Dumbledore should\\'ve told him EVERYTHING. All these damn secrets and mollycoddling Harry is WHY I get frustrated at Dumbledore. Harry\\'s inattentive behavior also frustrates me leaving Hermione to do it all. \\n \"He\\'s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?\" guffawed Ron. \"Blimey ... No wonder they don\\'t look too happy these days. I\\'m surprised they don\\'t tell him to stuff it.\" - Ron \\n tells us, transparent.\" \"Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we\\'re trying to tell them apart!\" said Ron. \"When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we\\'re going to be having a shufti to see if it\\'s solid, aren\\'t we, we\\'re not going to be asking, \\'Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?\\'\" - Ron \\n \"I have had it all tested for poison,\" he assured Harry, pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid\\'s bucket-sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. \"Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.\" - Slughorn \\n Kay, I don\\'t think too much of Slughorn \"Testing\" the alcohol on house elves. I wonder if Hermione ever found out. \\n \"He made a Horcrux? And that\\'s why he didn\\'t die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?\" - Harry \\n After all my re-reading. I\\'m still unsure of what exactly happened that night. I know it\\'s explained in Deathly Hallows I think but still *Shrugs* very confusing. \\n \"Of course not, Harry! Don\\'t you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\" - Dumbledore \\n No truer words have been spoken Dumbledore. In RL and Fiction. \\n Took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year \\n OH COME ON!!! I know your full of panic and all that, but to mention it means to register it! How can you not notice that it\\'s the same damn thing you hid in at Borgin and Burks! The same thing you saw when spying on Malfoy! god damn it! LOOK! \\n \"But you can\\'t call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where it\\'s landed him! And I\\'d have thought, seeing what this has done to your chances in the match --\" \"Oh, don\\'t start acting as though you understand Quidditch,\" snapped Ginny, \"you\\'ll only embarrass yourself.\" \\n Ha! Ha! Ha! GO GINNY!!! \\n \"I told her it\\'s a Hungarian Horntail,\" said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. \"Much more macho.\" \"Thanks,\" said Harry, grinning. \"And what did you tell her Ron\\'s got?\" \"A Pygmy Puff, but I didn\\'t say where.\" - Ginny/Harry \\n *Laughs* I really do like Ginny in this book! \\'bout time those two got together and even made Harry\\'s inner beat roar in triumph *Snickers* \\n \"Everything went pitch-black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the room!\" \"And you didn\\'t see that coming?\" said Harry, unable to help himself - Trelawney/Harry \\n \"It\\'s all my fault, all my fault,\" he sobbed. \"Please make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it stop and I\\'ll never, never again\" \\n *Tear* There\\'s just something about a charatcer like Dumbledore being brought to his knees that\\'s indecent and heartbreaking. \\n \"of course . . Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?\" \"Got there at last, have you?\" Malfoy taunted. \\n Puh-Lease! Oh NOW we decide to be all clever and put two and two together! *Grr* I hate it when JK does this. \\n \"What do I care how he looks? I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!\" she added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her. \\n GO FLEUR!! I like this scene! I wanted to add the Tonks/Remus scene but ran out of characters *Grins*, ALL THE TEARS, http://bookreaper.blogspot.com/2011/1..., Weer een geweldig Harry Potter boek!, In love, snape wtf, The initial disappointment with this book was that it was shorter than the previous title in the series. There was a lot more to it though. In it we learn about the life of the young Tom Riddle and his early days as Voldemort. Much of this back story was left out of the movie so I won\\'t go into it here. You\\'ll just have to read the series to find out., Out of all the Harry Potter books, The Half-Blood Prince is probably the most personal of all. We begin to really understand the character of Voldemort as well as Dumbledore. The book is filled with new information that we\\'ve been waiting for since the beginning. \\n After the fiasco at the Ministry of Magic, Harry now knows of the prophesy regarding him and Voldemort. He knows that \"neither can live while the other survives.\" So, it is during his sixth year at Hogwarts that Dumbledore begins personally instructing Harry about the Dark Lord, his secrets, and the steps that will be necessary to defeat him. \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Full Review, The last book that actually takes primary place in Hogwarts is perhaps one of my favorites of the series. While the style is basically the same old thing as forever, certain characteristics of Harry, Ron, and Hermione (and I suppose Malfoy) are finally blossoming like most of us have been waiting for them to for most of the series., One of the best in the series! \\n Just as good the 2ns, 3rd, and 4th time around, too., Spanning en heftige gebeurtenissen alom. Harry komt erachter dat Voldemort onsterfelijk is, omdat hij zijn ziel heeft opgedeeld. Hij moet alle stukken vinden en kapot maken, voordat Voldemort verslagen kan worden. Geen makkelijke gebeurtenis. En wie is de mysterieuze Half-Blood prince?, Like I mentioned before, this series splits (for me) into the first three books on one side, and the last books on the other. This review pertains to the last books in the series. \\n After reading the first books in the series, I was a bit disheartened, but was encouraged by a lot of people to give the last few books a try. And after reading them, I have to say, they\\'re a huge improvement and much more entertaining. It\\'s like the series \"grew up.\" The last few books have a much better plot and character development. Less cheesy dialogue is also nice. These books are an easy and addictive read. \\n I will say one thing, though. The most annoying thing about these books is that they don\\'t allow the reader to figure anything out on her own. It\\'s like the author is constantly hitting you over the head with the obvious (\"Hey! Hey reader! I just made mentioned a detail that I only briefly alluded to a few chapters ago! Did you catch that? You remember that little reference I made, foreshadowing this exact moment?? See! Here it is again! And just in case you don\\'t remember, I will repeat it for you!\") For someone who loves puzzles and loves picking up on subtle threads running through the story, I felt a little talked down to. But, if you take the books for what they are, they\\'re very enjoyable., ** spoiler alert ** \\n NO SNAPE NO!!! This book tears me up. Here Harry is finally getting over the death of Sirius and Dumbledore is killed. Not killed by just anyone, no, but by Harry\\'s worst enemy: Severus Snape. Plus the drama with Ginny and Harry; Ron and Lavender and Hermione. Won-Won definitely deserves a laugh... I almost feel like I need to hurry and read book number 7 so I can stop having this pit in my stomach. *sigh*, Okay, so the only review I ever wrote of the Harry Potter books was a review for the entire set. I\\'ve never reviewed them one by one and since I\\'m re-reading the series for the first time in a few years, I thought I\\'d give a go at reviewing them one by one. If you\\'re one of the few people in the world who haven\\'t read it, beware of some spoilers. \\n Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince \\n Oh my, talk about scathing reviews. People thought Order of the Phoenix was a downer, but they mostly hated this one. They called it fan fiction and a teenage romance novel. I can\\'t help but laugh at how people freaked out about this one. I also can\\'t explain how, but I was aware at the time that this sixth book was just the first \"half\" of the entire end of the story. That book six was more of a long preamble to book seven. So much of what went on in this book seemed like obvious misdirection. And it\\'s not a slight against Rowling\\'s writing abilities. I think it\\'s just because I was an adult reading the series who is a thinker as opposed to a feeler that I wasn\\'t as emotionally taken in as others were. I was just as interested as solving the story as I was in enjoying it. While everyone else was caught up in the hysteria, I was suspicious. Yes, there was definitely something wrong with this book. There were a lot of things that were a little too wrong with the book (deliberately wrong) that, once I realized it, made it intriguing and the perfect set up for the finale. There are many examples. First and probably overlooked by many was the fact that the beginning of the book switched POVs. For the entirety of the series, with the exception of a brief moment at the beginning of Goblet of Fire, the books had been written in the limited third person. The only person whose thoughts and feelings the reader was allowed to see was Harry\\'s. If something wasn\\'t happening directly to Harry or within his presence, we didn\\'t get to know about it until the thing was related to him by another character. The first two chapters of Half Blood Prince take place completely independently of Harry and his view of the events. Incidentally, I loved the chapter regarding the two Prime Ministers. There\\'s not a lot of new concepts introduced in this book, but the way the Minister of Magic communicates with the muggle Prime Minister another satisfying piece of world building. And the muggle PM will always be cast in my mind as Tony Blair, since he was PM of England at the time. The second primary example is the ending. This is the only book to end in a cliffhanger. In my other reviews I took note of the fact that each of the books in a long series had its own story with a definite, solid ending. Not this time. There were a bunch of loose ends dangling all over the final chapters of this book. Nothing was resolved and that was done on purpose. Voldemort was in the process of penetrating the Ministry but not much else is said on the subject. Harry got an in depth look at Voldemort\\'s past and none of it comes into play. In fact when the attempt is made to validate this part of the story, it ends with no sense of closure. The school was left in chaos and Harry\\'s destiny no longer lay there, but what he would do was not discussed or even planned carefully at this point. Dumbledore died so he wasn\\'t there to explain anything in the end. The only explanation you get is how his death was pulled off. So, it seems like the book had no purpose at all. Next was the fact that Harry\\'s instincts had lost some credibility with his friends after the sad results of the last book, which is a valid consequence don\\'t get me wrong. His obsessive behavior continued in this book, this time concerning Malfoy, but it seemed like an obvious feint to me... I knew he couldn\\'t be wrong twice in a row and he wasn\\'t, although it took an unexpected twist at the end. But, Snape killing Dumbledore was a red flag too, however I admit, it was probably just a red flag for me personally. Yes, the funeral was very sad and all of that, but I couldn\\'t feel the horrified shock that so many others were feeling at this twist because Rowling had done too good of a job making me trust Dumbledore\\'s judgement. Also, it honestly appeared to me that Snape was continuing to \"teach\" Harry even as he was fleeing the castle; a curious observation which I don\\'t think many other people picked up on. I couldn\\'t have guessed exactly what was up with this turn of events, but it all seemed very fishy to me. After all, Dumbledore had made him the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, which meant he knew that Snape wouldn\\'t be at the school after this year. So Snape\\'s betrayal left me more skeptical than outraged. \\n But even though my ability as an experienced reader caused me to not trust what I was reading and even to guess certain things (like the fact that Harry\\'s instincts were right this time and I also guessed immediately who R.A.B. was) I can\\'t call this a predictable book or disappointing in any way. Snape\\'s appointment to the cursed teaching position was a surprise and it was a surprise that I loved, by the way. She slipped in Slughorn as the Potions Master so smoothly, I found myself turning the pages back to see how easily I had been fooled. Slughorn is also a good representative of the fact that not all Slytherin kids turn out evil; he showcases a different direction that their ambitious natures can take them. Yes, Slytherin Phineas Nigellus was a former headmaster of the school, but his snarky attitude isn\\'t something we easily associate with good people. We get to learn about different magic potions in a more lighthearted atmosphere than there was under the leadership of Snape, and the moment where Harry convinces Slughorn to give him the his memory of a conversation he\\'d had with teenage Riddle was one of the best chapters of the entire series in my opinion. The complete about-face that Dumbledore made in suddenly spending a lot of quality time with Harry as opposed to ignoring him throughout the last book was wonderful, as was learning of Voldemort\\'s past. All of this along with the mysterious \"half-blood Prince\" of the old potions book and the strange attacks within the story made it just as interesting as all of the others even though the pacing was a little slower. The double climax of finding the fake horcrux and Dumbledore\\'s death made up for the slight shortage of intense moments. And, of course, that double climax held the real purpose of all the seemingly random meanderings of the story. Dumbledore had to be eliminated from the equation before Harry could defeat Voldemort. Had he remained alive, Harry would\\'ve had his protection for years and Voldemort would\\'ve been endlessly thwarted. The fact that his death seemed to be in vain added motivation and urgency to the cause. And it took the entirety of a book to pull off this murder to explore the concept of the horcruxes. The different kind of magic, the dangers involved in retrieving them, and their part in the destruction of Voldemort are what lays the groundwork for the transition of the story\\'s primary setting away from the school grounds in the next book. \\n So, the angle of the various teenage romances filled the spaces in between critical plot points. I wasn\\'t put off by this, like other people were. After all, these are sixteen-year-old kids and what sixteen-year-old isn\\'t in love? It was their last \"normal\" year so they were behaving as normal teenagers do, only more responsibly if you get right down to it. Normal to the point of taking apparition tests the way regular teens take driving tests... just another layer in the big picture that makes the story so real. But all of the silliness of the girls and the swaggering of the boys is as true to life as anything else. Rowling has since indicated that she thinks it would\\'ve made more sense for Harry to end up with Hermione instead of Ginny, but I think the Harry/Ginny pairing was the right thing to do. Rowling\\'s instincts were right and she shouldn\\'t doubt them. Harry is a hero and it\\'s psychologically valid there would need to be a certain element of hero-worship from his love, which Ginny always had for him even though she grew to be his equal. He would never have had that with Hermione who always looked at him as an equal and often bossed and mothered him as she did Ron who, having grown up with a domineering mother, needed someone like Hermione as a mate. The only thing I would\\'ve changed is that she should\\'ve started developing Ginny\\'s character a little sooner in, say, the fourth book because I can see how she and Harry\\'s relationship can seem kind of sudden and \"out of the blue.\" And perhaps that\\'s why people didn\\'t respond as favorably to this part of the story. I think they also didn\\'t like the other love stories as well... Bill and Fleur; Lupin and Tonks... but love and being in love would be a big part of the outcome of the story and those who were patient enough to sit through the slush would understand in the end. \\n Half-Blood Prince isn\\'t the best book of the series and it\\'s not meant to be and I think looking too critically at it is a bit unfair. This book was a vehicle for setting the stage for Deathly Hallows. It officially sets Harry on the course that he couldn\\'t realistically have started at a younger age and takes away the protection and wisdom of Dumbledore so that he will truly become the hero of the story, relying on his own talents and instincts with help from his equals, not his superiors. And there was enough cool stuff in it with the trip to the cave to retrieve the locket, the confrontation between Harry and Scrimgeour, and the breech of Hogwarts at the end to validate its place in the series., NOOOOOOOO!! Dumbledore gets killed? Did not see that coming. There were so many twists and turns, just like the Goblet of Fire. This one is so enjoyable because you\\'re into the meat of the story. \\n The thing I loved about Dumbledore was how calm he always was. Even in the end he kept his cool. The Bob Marley of the Wizarding World. \\n As we move towards the 7th and final book I\\'m a bit sad. I finally can feel the pain that everyone else felt when the story was over. I wish there was more. She needs to write prequels and off-shoots. \\n This has been such a fun thing to do with Hilary., There\\'s no way denying the fact that this is a great book. 6th book in the series where the Dark Lord is rising again. Hogwarts as well as the magical world is in grave danger. It\\'s up to Harry how he\\'ll save whatever that was in the prophecy. With Sirius\\'s death, Harry inherited all his property. But it left him in despair and he has never been this sad. Dumbledore comes to his uncle\\'s house to take him to complete a task where Harry had to persuade Slughorn to return to Hogwarts. \\n Back in Hogwarts, students are in danger. Parents are worried to leave their kids. There have been several attacks which were done by the death eaters by various curses. \\n This is the book where a detail of Voldemort\\'s past is given - who were his parents, how he became the dark lord. This book also introduced the reader to horcruxes. \\n My personal feeling after reading the book is that \\n 1. I hate Snape and Malfoy \\n 2. I will never ship Harry and Ginny and I also dislike Ginny \\n 3. I simply couldn\\'t stand Dumbledore\\'s death, I have mixed feelings about this book. I love it but at the same time I mourn it. I love all the private lessons Harry has with Dumbledore, the final coming of age, and the connection of Snape to Harry clarification and muddling. I mourn the later part of the book but still read it like it is the first time reading it... without putting it down!, We learned so much more about Dumbledore in this one, but then he gets taken away in the worst way possible. I loved the Half-Blooded prince on paper and I absolutely cannot believe who it turned out to be since I don\\'t like that character., extremely distraught...starting book 7 immediately, Synopsis: \\n Hogwarts year 6 starts off with a stark reminder that the war against Lord Voldemort is not going well. So bad, in fact, that the Muggle Prime Minister received a visit from former Prime Minister Fudge and new Prime Minister Scrimgeour. To the Prime Minister\\'s surprise, the events of the previous months that have muggles on edge are due to Lord Voldemort\\'s Death Eaters, not incompetent government offices and the Prime Minister is not happy that the wizarding world has been unable to maintain control. \\n The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister. \\n The return to Hogwarts is different than previous years even for students. Hermione and Ron scan The Daily Prophet for names they might recognize, Dumbledore is often absent, and Snape has finally won the teaching position he has been envying. The plus side of being a 6th year, however, is finally learning how to Apparate. Classes are getting harder and students are nose-deep in books, but the war against Voldemort is just beginning. \\n Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure. \\n Harry receives help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince in Potions class and continues to attempt to convince Dumbledore that there is something sinister going on behind his back. Dumbledore, wiser than he may seem, brushes off Harry\\'s accusations and decides the time has come to give Harry private lessons. The lessons seem trivial to Harry at first, but he learns more from then than in all his time spent at Hogwarts. The time has come to face fears and join together to defeat the Dark Lord. \\n It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. \\n Review: \\n Of all the Harry Potter books, this was my favorite. With that said, I still have the final book in the series that I have yet to read, so that may change. \\n There were more noticeable differences between this book and the film adaptation and that makes me a little sad. The changes that were made to the films, while good in their own right, took away from the story. The opening scene of the Muggle Prime Minister and Prime Minister Scrimgeour talking about what has been going on in the wizarding world and Lord Voldemort answered a lot of those questions that were left open in the films. What does do the muggle officials do? Do people actually notice there is something happening? Are the results of Lord Voldemort\\'s return felt in the muggle world or is it all conveniently erased? All of that is answered in a way in the very opening of the book, which I really liked and appreciated. \\n I was more hesitant to read this book than the previous 5 only because I know the ending thanks to the movies. Not that watching the movies before reading the books took away from anything, because these are so beautifully written they are fantastic by themselves. Regardless of knowing the outcome, I still was sad when the ending came. I still was angry at Snape and sad that Dumbledore is actually gone. NOT DUMBLEDORE!!! The funeral scene (left out from the movie) made me cry. I could see Hagrid, Harry, Hermione, and Ron looking at their beloved headmaster. I could feel the tension and the grief and I was fighting back tears at the loss. Oh, J.K. Rowling, you got me with this one. \\n Not that there is much more to say about this that hasn\\'t already been said by myself and other fellow Harry Potter fans, but this book series is amazing. It reminds me of how I felt when I read the Narnia Chronicles for the first time as a child. The magic is real. I believe it is real and I am transported to a world where it is as normal to see a person perform magic as it is to see someone riding a bike. These are the kinds of books I lived for as a child and still love with all my heart. \\n It isn\\'t overly descriptive or full of complicated language. I don\\'t have to look up words I\\'m unfamiliar with and re-read paragraphs because I\\'ve dozed off and started day-dreaming. The wizarding world is what I daydream of and I not-so-secretly am waiting for my Hogwarts letter. I\\'m pretty certain it was lost in the mail because delivering it to the U.S. by owl would have been too exhausting of a trip., ** spoiler alert ** \\n May 2015: \\n I always forget what happens in this book. HOW?! It\\'s perfection. But in every other book Harry has a showdown with Voldemort and in this one...I think to myself, Well I know he doesn\\'t fight with Voldemort so what the heck does happen? Um, everything else. The search for the Horcruxes begins! We get closer to Dumbledore! SNAPE. Snape is everything. I will not go on and on. I will just say this is my favorite HP. That is saying something, folks. \\n July 2009: \\n I read this in anticipation of the movie coming out. It got me so pumped up b/c I forgot how much I loved Book 6. So many characters are filled out... \\n Learning more about Voldemort, watching the progress of evil in his face and actions, is fascinating and creepy. We get to see Dumbledore in a couple of vulnerable moments, which we hadn\\'t seen before. (The next book takes this even further, asking about Dumbledore\\'s motivations, etc.) Draco, oh poor Draco, begins to learn that maybe he doesn\\'t want to be evil after all because true evil is quite different than just being a bully. And Snape. I never could believe that Snape was really bad (even after you know what happened) because you just trusted that Dumbledore knew something about Snape that nobody else got. But poor Harry--trusting Snape all year long (in the form of the Half-Blood Prince), only to be let down in the end. (Did anybody else think that part fell so flat in the movie? Snape announcing that he was, in fact, the Half-Blood Prince. Eek, it might have been the worst part of the movie, which is too bad. Eh.) Comparing and contrasting Voldemort, Snape, and Harry really comes out well but subtly in the book. And finally, because we can\\'t have too much heavy stuff, Harry, Ron, and Hermione offer some lighter moments and comic relief as their characters are fleshed out by giving them love lives. \\n And just to throw this in there (I promised myself I wouldn\\'t compare the book and the movie--that\\'s pointless, and I could go on all day about it--but I have to say it)--my FAVORITE part of the whole book is when Fleur comes to the hospital wing of Hogwarts after Bill\\'s face has been slashed by Greyback. Saying that she\\'s beautiful enough for the both of them and that his scars only show that her husband is brave--it\\'s just so sweet and cute. Of course the movie didn\\'t have time for any sort of real Weasley dynamics (okay, whatever, they played up Ginny a lot, and threw in that scene with The Burrow and the fire, etc.???), but you know what I mean. They always miss the best fun stuff., 2015 Reading Challenge: A Book with Magic., It doesn\\'t matter how many times I read this series, I\\'ll always love it every single time., (May Contain Spoilers) \\n So, it has been an awful long time since I picked up a book. The last book I read was Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix in November. I have been fairly busy for both December & January understandably with holidays & birthdays etc. But I have finally read & finished the Half Blood Prince as I had hoped by March before my book club started. (Although I had hoped to read both #6 & #7 by then...) \\n This book, as the previous books do, follow Harry along his school-year journey at Hogwarts. It follows his and his friends journey throughout his 6th year in school, about his becoming Quidditch captain, about coming across a potions book that was owned by a previous student,which helped him throughout his new potions class, and a love interest. \\n He became captain of the Gryffindor Quittich team this year, and had put together a team filled with friends and great players, that surprising everyone in tryouts, was Ron, who due to his nerves, had done badly the year before. They were confident they would win this year, and they didn\\'t have any reason to believe otherwise include of course things had begun to go wrong. Because, every year, something goes wrong in Hogwarts, and it seemed this year would be no different. \\n Harry had come across a potions text book, that had writing throughout, that helped him better in potions. Even better than Hermione. Which of course, she was upset about. But he quickly became, the new potions teachers favorite, since Snape had taken up the Defense Against the Dark Arts position. Could Shape really be trusted? And what of this potion book?- as we know, following things written in books has fared the group disastrous in the past. \\n Malfoy is up to something, and Harry is determined more than ever to find out what. He suspects that Malfoy is now a Death Eater- but no one believes him, because no one thinks that Voldemort would require the help of a 16 year old over his trusted Death Eaters. And when mysterious occurances happen, it furthers Harry\\'s accusation of Malfoy. \\n I cried during the end, when Death claimed yet another life. I was toying with my own emotions, not wanting to believe what I had read, but it surely couldn\\'t have been true? \\n I again, give this book 4 out of 5. \\n I really enjoyed reading it, and could see why everyone loves these books so much. And I can\\'t wait to find out what happens in the next book!, The book with the greatest potential and the greatest let down. \\n Don\\'t get me wrong, the Harry Potter series (the first four at least) can be enchanting, engaging and a truly worthy read... \\n ... BUT it\\'s not worth the hype. I could name HUNDREDS of books and a score of series that would be a better use of your time than HP but, sadly, did not receive the \"hype\" this series did. Until the last two, somewhat three, books were read, I was somewhat of a Potter nut. I gave the fourth book five stars for a reason, after all. But starting at the fifth book, the story begins to fall off track. \\n The sixth book was downright disappointing, the fact that a FAN GIRL gets the hero annoyed me, the seventh book, had it\\'s moments, I admit but Rowling should be shot for that pathetic epilogue. I\\'ve seen better writing from ten year olds and I am not exaggerating. \\n Over all, I would tell you to try the series out. It\\'s been a great gate-way book into other (more worthy) fantasy books for many, many people and HAS convinced many kids out there that reading can be fun! It\\'s one of the few series out there that I believe will have some historical value because of that fact. \\n If you are looking for an astoundingly great read, however... \\n ... look elsewhere.(, It is my favourite from the series. I cannot tell you why, but this book warms my heart all over., re-read in 2016. This is a great book. It\\'s amazing to see how she has set up so much in the previous books and brings some of it to light in this book., AWESOME!!!!, Absolutely Brilliant! One of my favorite so far! On to Deathly Hallows!!, , Absolutely loved it! I had to take a minute to calm down a little after that ending though..., J. K. Rowling destroying my soul one book at a time! The saddest yet, even though I\\'ve read them before I\\'m still an emotional blob of tears instead of a person, Possibly my favorite in the series. I just love it., Author J.K. Rowling returns back to form in the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series. Although the darkness from the later novels is ever present, the magic and charm from the first books in the series returns to bring a nice balance to this novel., Nice story that includes teenage troubles and early love. Sometimes it\\'s hard for me to believe I literally watched these characters grow up through the six books. It\\'s as if I actually was there to watch them grow up. Well, time for the final book. I\\'m ready., I loved all the Harry Potter Books, I absolutely love this entire series. Very well written, brilliant imagination and a book I could read ten times over and fall in love with it over again., il mio preferito (doni della morte escluso)., Harry Potter and the Half-Prince just became my favorite book in the series. Thomas Fuller said \"the darkest hour comes just before the dawn\" and though the ending of Book 6 leaves the reader fearful and uncertain, there\\'s also a sense that things will work out in the end as they should., A page-turner for sure!, \"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" -- Albus Dumbledore \\n I have some mixed feelings about this book because: \\n 1. No book could ever be better than the previous book \\n 2. The history of Tom Riddle (Voldemort) is amazing, because you realize he isn\\'t just evil to be evil, there are actual reasons in his background to why he turned to the dark side \\n 3. This book is basically just a bridge between the previous one and the next \\n 4. Learning about the Horcruxes is a great storyline \\n 3. I barely survived the ending of this after the ending of the previous one \\n Mixed feelings, indeed. That\\'s why this book just barely tops Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which is my least favorite book in this series. \\n Here you can read my review of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone (Book #1) \\n Here you can read my review of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Book #2) \\n Here you can read my review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Book #3) \\n Here you can read my review of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Book #4) \\n Here you can read my review of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book #5) \\n Here you can read my review of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book #7), One of my favorite Harry\\'s., OMG THIS BROKE MY HEART! ;((((((((((((((((((, Ahhhhhh I loved this book so much!!!, I cannot believe I am at the end of this series. I\\'m broken LOL. It\\'s difficult for me to review these books, but after Deathly Hallows I think I am going to do a huge wrap up post on the blog!! AAaaahhhh, I would rate this ten stars if I could., Like a lot of people, I\\'m sure, I was out last night at midnight picking up my copy of the eagerly anticipated Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I went to the grocery, anticipating not only no lines, but also that I could purchase other things I needed, and get home faster to begin reading. I\\'ve read each of the Harry Potter novels by J.K. Rowling in less than a day, but today, having finished the sixth installment, the feeling is somehow different. \\n ::: Beyond the Order ::: \\n The blurb on the inside of the book jacket gives the reader a clue that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is going to be somewhat different, focusing on the everyday at the wizarding school Hogwarts rather than events happening outside the school. As the story begins, Professor Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster at Hogwarts and Harry\\'s staunchest protector against the evil wizard Lord Voldemort, comes to fetch Harry at his aunt and uncle\\'s home during the summer holidays. Harry\\'s family, Muggles (non-wizards) all, display their usual fright at being confronted with anyone from the wizarding community. \\n As Dumbledore escorts Harry to the Burrow, home of Harry\\'s best friend Ron\\'s family, for the rest of the summer, he lets Harry know that he will be giving him private lessons over the course of the school year. He also has a task for Harry; luring a new professor to Hogwarts, Professor Slughorn, who the reader assumes will take over the Defense Against the Dark Arts position that somehow ends up vacant every year. \\n Of course, with Rowling, things are never as they initially seem. Dumbledore\\'s private lessons with Harry actually consist of delving into Lord Voldemort\\'s history. Slughorn, who seems to want to cultivate a small cult of students who will move on to bigger things, or have important connections, doesn\\'t actually become the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. And Harry\\'s ongoing battle against Voldemort takes several unexpected turns. \\n ::: The New Harry ::: \\n While Rowling\\'s twists in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince live up to her usual gift of surprise, including the source of the assistance that Harry gets from the Half-Blood Prince of the title, there are too many plot devices, sub-plots, and characters left hanging. Fred and George Weasley, usually so entertaining, appear at the beginning of the book and then get little more than a mention for the rest of the book. An engagement between Bill Weasley and the former Beauxbatons student Fleur Delacour seems almost pointless, and the \"intrigue\" regarding the depressed condition of the Auror Nymphadora Tonks is similarly introduced and then wrapped up a bit too tidily. Even Professor Slughorn seems to have little to do other than one plot point that fits in a bit too neatly with Dumbledore\\'s charge to Harry. Even more noticeable, the irritable teen of Order of the Phoenix has been replaced with an almost unbelievably mature Harry, who seems to have accepted the loss of his godfather much too stoicly for a 16-year-old boy. \\n This is a new Harry, one who is nearly an adult. But it feels at time as if Rowling has lost touch with her character. The listing for the audio book includes Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince as part of the Romance genre, and while you expect that 16-year-olds have some raging hormones, at times, everything else takes a back seat to the \"who is snogging with whom\" game. \\n Probably the biggest surprise to me was how much less dark and violent Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is compared to the previous two books. My five-year-old daughter has fallen in love with Harry Potter, and while I\\'ve let her read the first three books, the violence in Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix are too much, in my opinion, I probably would let her have this one. Rowling\\'s dedication of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is to her baby daughter, and the reader is left to wonder if perhaps her feelings about pregnancy lightened the mood a bit. The series, up until this point, had gotten progressively darker, and yet Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, even with the darkest wizard ever known back in full power, seems almost Pollyanna-ish at times. \\n Still, for Harry Potter fans, it\\'s been a long wait, and at nearly 700 pages, it\\'s still worth the read. While too many plotlines are tied up a bit too neatly, it\\'s at least a bit refreshing to have had so many questions answered that have been left by the previous six books. No Harry Potter fan will be left unaffected by the ending, and once again, Rowling will leave fans clamoring for more, waiting for the last installment, which promises to be very different from the previous six books. \\n This review previously published at Epinions: http://www.epinions.com/review/Book_H..., The HBP was my very least favorite book. It dragged on and on about stuff that wasn\\'t important, it didn\\'t get good until about chapter 20. At one point I wasn\\'t sure if I could finish it. One thing I will say is it was nothing like the movie; there were a lot of important people and events that the movie did leave out. I am dreading to read the last one, but excited as well. The story is great; I just hate how it is written., Yet another wonderful read, and such a heart breaking ending., This one might actually be able to challenenge Prisoner of Azkaban for favorite in the series. love love love it. Still remember my sister screaming from teh other room when she got to a certain pivotal part in the book. So well written., \"Oh come and stir my cauldron \\n And if you do it right, \\n I\\'ll boil you up some hot strong love \\n To keep you warm tonight.\" \\n --Celestina Warbeck \\n \"I am not worried, Harry. I am with you.\", My favorite book of the series, To say the truth.. till this day I view this book as a really long Prologue to Deathly Hallows. \\n This is the book that set it all in action. for a whole year and half after it.. it set my head swirling trying to identify the rest of the Horcruxes.. and Identifying them I did =D (I was never as much proud of myself as I was by discerning about the locket B) *yup I\\'m brilliant*.. and Naguini and Harry himself. \\n I couldn\\'t believe what happened to DD. I thought it might be a hoax.. but when I thought more about it.. I realized it isn\\'t. \\n This is the book when Voldemort is at his most horrifying.. \\n We get to know how he came to this life.. a sad story and you can\\'t but pity his mom. \\n We get to know how his life was at the orphanage.. an uneasy child he was and a creepy one.. no wonder how his dislike for muggles who averted him and disliked him back came to be. \\n We get to know how attractive teenager and powerful wizard he was.. and how he wasted it. \\n Voldemort\\'s background doesn\\'t excuse his horrible ways and let us understand why he became the dark lord.. \\n no it emphasizes how it\\'s our minds and our choices that set our course. \\n Like Voldy, Harry\\'s parents were out of the picture even before he can picture them. \\n Like Voldy, Harry lived as an orphan.. but even worse his \"family\" made him feel more orphaned than any orphanage can make a child feel. \\n Like Voldy, Harry was a peculiar child with no friends. \\n But unlike Voldy, Harry decided not to let all this erase his faith in Good and justify why he may act Bad. \\n A better message a writer can send to the world can never be. <3, Four stars, finally! This is a great lead-in to the Deathly Hallows. While the Half-Blood Prince is the one that gets Harry through Potions the entire year (and learned a few hexes from him that helped throughout), I didn\\'t really feel that it necessarily warranted the name of the book. This almost feels like a Deathly Hallows Part I more than anything. This book moved, it was interesting, and the end didn\\'t end with all the good guys happy and everything magically going right (even with the Felix Felicis). Also, Ginny is awesome., I thought Professor D was gay., This one once again was really good. Although it really pulled at those heart strings. I love the whole Bill and Fleur situation it was great. I also really enjoyed how the other relationships developed. The ending really killed me though. Overall good job to J.K. She wrote a great book., I AM NOT OKAY., Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince takes up the story of Harry Potter\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at this point in the midst of the storm of this battle of good and evil. Dumbledore starts to spend more time with Harry outside of school and while they\\'re away an evil plot is taking form within the castle walls that will change the course of the story forever, ** spoiler alert ** \\n OH DUMBLEDORE! I swear, all the important characters are being killed off. Dumbledore is awesome. Such a wise old man with a fantastic beard., What a ride., WOW! This book was amazing, intense and thrilling in every word. I wish I could take some of the stars that I gave to other books and give this one more. I think Rowling managed to accomplish the transition from child to adult of Harry (and his friends to a degree as well) in this book much more effectively that she had in the previous books. \\n The series now seems to have much more of a focus and a drive. The last 100 pages (at least) were so suspenseful and had so much going on that I could not stop reading. I loved all of the intrigue and constant motion. \\n I wish that Slughorn would have gotten developed a little bit more. I definitely have a pretty good sense of him but as the new teacher I guess it just seems that he should play a more central role at the end of the book. I was also surprised we didn\\'t see more of the Order on a regular basis. \\n One of the last things I\\'ll say is that this is the perfect example of what a cliff hanger ending should be. Normally I hate them but this one definitely seems to be a complete story that leaves me satisfied and not frustrated. It also has me wondering where Rowling is going to go with the last book. \\n In my opinion, the entire series would be worth reading for this book alone., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I have to admit that I really enjoyed it and I couldn\\'t put it down. I was shocked that Dumbledore died but there was so much going on that I didn\\'t get emotional. I will really miss him in the next book. I can\\'t wait to read the next and see what happens between Harry & Snape., full of secrets and adventures. a turning point to the series, ** spoiler alert ** \\n No entiendo porque dicen que este es el libro mas aburrido... \\n Con este libro rei, llore, le grite a los personajes, hice lo que nunca habia hecho con un libro. \\n Lo peor fue la muerte de Dumbledore, hubieran visto mi llanto (llore por media hora sin parar), me llego mucho este libro y la verdad es que lo disfrute mucho. Aunque ya sabia quien era el Principe Mestizo y sabia quienes morian en este libro, me encanto, lo disfrute y lo ame. Definitivamente la saga de HP esta calificada como una de las mejores sagas que han existido. \\n Siento que no estoy preparada para el ultimo libro porque no quiero que acabe la saga. Es que con HP ?Quien no se la pasa muy bien leyendolo?, OMG. How could Snape do that., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Obviously I could give this book anything less than a 5 star rating but I completely mean it. I really enjoyed rereading this book. Like the fifth one I think that I forgot a lot about what happens in this book. I really loved the memory scenes with past Voldemort/Tom Riddle. I also really enjoyed reading about the Half-Blood Prince while knowing who it really was. If I\\'m honest. One of the best parts was reading the chapters where Harry and Ginny are actually happy together. In the midst of all the darkness of this part of the series I was genuinely happy to see them together. I also really loved reading the Draco storyline and seeing him develop from the bully of the last few books into a fully developed and complex character. I finally remember why I love Draco in this book. This book made me laugh and cry and I\\'m reminded why this is one of the only series that I will love for my whole life!, But things begin to slowly move on, not that Harry intended to but things did. And I actually like this book a lot. There is a lot of Snape-feelings to it., This is my favorite book. I\\'m currently re-reading it., I used to rank these books but the reread has completely ruined any hope of that. How are these books so good?????, Of all the books probably it felt like the least happened here, even if (SPOILER!!!) Dumbledore did snuff it. Still it\\'s more Potter and that\\'s what fans want., As soon as the date for the 7th book was confirmed, I pulled #6 from the shelf. I hadn\\'t read it since it was released two years ago and I didn\\'t want to bring it to NZ with me because it\\'s too big. Too big to read once again and then what? So, I was in the middle of The Time Traveler\\'s Wife but dropped that to reread Harry. I usually take months and years between these books, so I always forget what happens and it\\'s like reading it for the first time. I had only read this one once and almost 2 years ago. It was like a new book to me. And I can\\'t read the books too close to the film release because I did that with #3 and it ruined the film. So now, I can\\'t do it within 6 months of release. I forget what happens in #5, but I can\\'t reread it until the movie comes out, because we are within 6 months. It\\'s such a catch-22 with this series and me. I love that there is so much though and I can just pick up a random book or movie and totally have forgotten what happened, but know that I loved it and read and watch it like new again. \\n Ya\\'lls have read the book. I am not even going to talk about the plot at all. I will say that I liked it better the 2nd time around because I felt like I could take my time with reading it. The first time you read these books, it\\'s like a sprint. You just want to get to the end to know what happens so you won\\'t be spoiled when Monday comes around. This time, I read the book like a marathon. I took a break between each chapter so I could appreciate them more and think about them, especially when it comes to like the last 5 chapters. They are very dense and I remember in the past just kind of skimming them, getting the jist, but not understand or picture what was going on. This time, it took me like, 5 days to read it, but I read at a very good pace. I just need to learn how to do that for #7 and I\\'ll be fine. Most likely won\\'t happen though. But nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, I am getting the book 5 hours ahead of EST and 8 ahead of PST. See ya all on the flipside! I\\'ll let you know what happens!! \\n Updated as of 6-May-2009: \\n I quite enjoyed this book. I like a story told in flashback and half this book was. It was easy to compartmentalise all the stories and divide it all up. I am a little worried that I read this book to close to the movie release day, but fingers crossed the movie won\\'t be too ruined for me. Since the film hasn\\'t been released yet, I don\\'t have a story about that and this was the only book that I was int he US for the release for. I don\\'t do midnight releases as it\\'s not like I am going to start reading then (I value my sleep) so I just woke up nice and early on Saturday, ran to Barnes (which the location I bought this book at doesn\\'t exist anymore), it wasn\\'t on the racks, so went to the counter and they had them all stacked there. You didn\\'t even need to say the title, you just say how many copies you need and they ring it up for you. I remember flying through my reading of this book the first time because I didn\\'t want anything to be ruined when Monday came and I didn\\'t comprehend it very well, even though technically I did finish it in two days. I think I also reread it before I went to NZ because I knew the next one would come out while I was overseas and I didn\\'t want to lug this book with me because the only copy I own is the US Hardcover edition. So I guess, I have only read it 3 times. But I will definitely be reading it again. \\n Grade: B, Neither can live while the other survives. This is the prophecy that haunts Harry throughout his sixth year at Hogwarts. He now knows that he has no choice but to face Voldemort, and to do such he must find his weak spot. With Dumbledore\\'s asistance, Harry ventures into Voldemort\\'s past, and finds the secret to his destruction. The goings-on inside Hogwarts take center stage in this novel, with the students battling their way through classes, Quidditch tryouts, and love. Dramatic battles and Draco\\'s serious dilema lead to breath-taking,screaming, gasp-inducing moments that we cannot forgive Rowling for. Just to warn you, there will be tears. Hilarious in parts yet serious in others, Harry Potter 6 is not a disapointment. Despite the heartbreak, I loved every moment of it., This whole series is so wonderful! I had to read this again in preparation for the movie coming out this fall. I can\\'t wait to see the movie and re-read the last book again!!, This book made me cry it was sooo sad!, Dumbledore\\'s death still gets me., Another one of my favorites in the series!, The best book so far, it really captures JK Rowling\\'s brilliance. I am extremely sad I have cried too much everything has just turned into dry sobs, very scared to finish the series I don\\'t know how many tears left I can shed!, Let\\'s be honest here, do I really even need to say anything?, This is by far, my most favorite book, in this series...or maybe Deathly Hallows is? I\\'m not sure I can consider them seperate books. They must be read together as one story., How does this book still make me cry after Years? Such a wonderful chapter in the Harry Potter story. I\\'m still as attached to the characters as when I first read about them. [?], Ah, my initial memories of these one are somewhat tarnished. I desperately waited for the new installment, waiting at the bookstore with friends, and when we finally received our copies, one of them flipped to the back and shrieked Snape kills Dumbledore! and it kind of let it down. I still love this book though, then and now, because we see all that has happened up until this point makes sense. I also desperately defended Snape, much to the disbelief of my friends. I believed there was something in the pleading, and in the argument Hagrid overheard, but it was still with a sinking heart that I read it, and I hoped with all my heart I\\'d be proven right. I sure was! \\n On to the final book in this reread that I do periodically. Harry Potter is as much alive in my every day now as it was when I was waiting for books and movies; I have over 1600 facebook pages updating me with HP news every day after all!, This book was very good. It sucked me in so that I was reading 100 pages in 2 days!!!, Now this is what I am talking about! This book is J.K\\'s best book so far! It has the fast paced qualities that I loved but it was also long enough that I had lots to enjoy - unlike the incredibly long and boring book before this one. J.K has learned a few things with this book. \\n In this book we see the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore grow. He picks up Harry from his uncles home and brings him to The Burrow to stay with The Weasley\\'s and Hermoine. There is a new teacher that Dumbledore wants to recruit and brings Harry with him to persuade this teacher. He was an old professor at the school and he even taught Tom Riddle. There is a memory that Dumbledore wants from him and feels that Harry is the only one that can get it out of him. We learn what a Horcrux is with this memory. Dumbledore and Harry set out to find them and destroy them. Meanwhile Harry has a feeling that Malfoy is up to something evil since he is now part of the Death Eaters. He tries his best to find out what, but Malfoy seems to be one step ahead of him every time. \\n All and all it was a really good book. I found myself wanting to read more and not really being able to put it down when the good parts came. I can\\'t wait to read the next one. \\n I don\\'t know how I feel about the movie. Normally in this series the movies have been better than the books, but I feel in this case the movie left out a lot of action scenes especially at the end when the Aurors and a couple members from the DA helped attack the Death Eaters. I don\\'t know. It was a good movie, but not the best. I hope the last book does this series justice!, Ava said that her favorite part was Dumbledore\\'s death because it was so well written, and not because he died because that was awful. She\\'s ready for Harry to find all the Horcrux., cried like a baby all over again., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Dumbledore is dead, Harry is not going back to Hogwarts, but is rather going to find all Horcruxes and destroy them. Ron and Hermione are determined to help him in his quest. Ginny left behind because being with her would make it much too easy for Lord Voldemort to get to them. On to the next book then..., \"Severus ... please ...\" \\n This book broke my soul into so many pieces, it would put Voldemort to shame. \\n \"There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before.\" \\n Never before, in all my re-reads of Harry Potter, had I realized how AMAZING Dumbledore was. And not just that, but how much Harry relied on him. \\n Dumbledore was \"The Only One He Ever Feared\", and honestly i can not believe my 13-year-old-self, i was such an idiot for not loving that man. \\n AND DRACO MALFOY\\'S CHARACTER BUILDING \\n Seeing self-confident, narcissistic Draco cry was shocking. And how he didn\\'t kill Dumbledore even when Voldemort threatened his life? BRILLIANT character progress! \\n Book 7 here i come! (Don\\'t break my heart please), Definitely one of my favorite 3 Harry Potter books. Now Harry no longer had the protection of Dumbledore and Hogwarts got sacked. This changed how the last book was even written, given that the last 5 followed a formula of Harry being in the real world, went to Hogwarts for the year then left for the summer by the end of each book., The books kept getting better and better! The suspense grows as we learn even more about Harry\\'s past and guess about his future. Once again very nicely put togeher and well written!, The most emotional story of H.P. Series, will make you real sad, I love this book. One of my favorite series! <3, Lucky for those reading the HP series now. I feel I needed to go back and read this again after I finished #7. It wasn\\'t my favorite, but it served a VERY important purpose...it told us about the life of Tom Riddle. \\n Going to read again just to update myself--hopefully before the movie comes out., Check out Book vs Movie comparison of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince at my blog and share your opinion! http://www.pottertalk.net/2014/03/boo... \\n In the sixth installment of Harry Potter facing off against Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore becomes a stronger leader and grandfather figure to the boy who lived than ever before. Perhaps the most suspenseful mystery that brings them closest together comes from the most grueling and devastating circumstances. To understand how Tom Riddle came to the inexhaustible hatred that lingers where his soul would be (if he had one), the beloved Headmaster reveals to young Potter a series of important memories connected to Slytherin\\'s heir. The prophecy stated \"neither one can live while the other survives\", and in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, we finally figure out why. \\n Rating The Book \\n The violent and relentless mystique of Voldemort\\'s motivations explored throughout the book comes to close without losing an ounce of oomph. The revelation of Tom Riddle\\'s parents and childhood is a major page turner - perhaps the biggest story since Prisoner of Azkaban. After all the murders and manipulation Riddle commits in order to become the immortal heartless Lord Voldemort we\\'ve been hearing about in the past five books, the stakes are raised to its most pain-inducing loss so far. \\n Half Blood Prince may be Rowlings most sharp and balanced novel of the series. Her prose equally balances all the hormonal ranges of the characters without becoming redundant or exceptionally pervy. The story sustains mystery while revealing all of Lord Voldemort\\'s skeletons in his closet. I would have preferred if some of Riddle\\'s history hadn\\'t been so restricted to Dumbledore\\'s longwinded speeches and continuously jumping into the Penseive, but those are just nitpicky complaints. \\n Perhaps my biggest complaint for the book is how two-sided Ron Weasley is in both the books and films. It\\'s no secret that his transformation to the big screen would be almost intolerable if it wasn\\'t for the splendid subtle acting by Rupert Grint. However, on that note, I felt like Rowling really tried to keep Mr. Weasley in a box while the rest of the characters had ample opportunities to show different sides of themselves and evolve. Every brilliant choice or action Ron made, or could\\'ve made instead of dumbing down his personality and abilities, was usually swept under the rug or disregarded.... \\n In what may be Rowling\\'s best constructed novel of the series, her prose and focus of the storyline does not wander too aimlessly through side storylines or scenes that don\\'t push the plot forward. The prolonged quarrels between the golden trio, or Hermione Granger\\'s stubborn efforts to get S.P.E.W. off the ground doesn\\'t infinitely absorb numerous chapters like in Order of the Phoenix or Goblet of Fire, respectively. While much of what Rowling provides is pitch-perfect for delving into her world-building, sometimes her plots lose focus. With Half Blood Prince, ninety-percent of the character interactions serve a purpose to either push the overall story forward, or their own. It\\'s entertaining and engrossing without going all over the map (Order of the Phoenix finale, anyone?)., Book 6 of the 7 series of Harry Potter. I have managed to make it through the series although I honestly don\\'t see what the big deal is. they are enjoyable stories, but I don\\'t understand how everything is \"cured\" with the use of a wand. \\n This book, however, was the best one yet and I truly enjoyed it. I can only hope that the last book is as good., Not my favorite, but still a fantastic story., I personally think Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix is more funny, entertaining and worthwhile to read., great book as alway. i hate that this series has ended and i am 54. what a same, Um, I\\'m sure I took the day off to read this. And I screamed at the end., Great how JK Rowling explains about all of the misadventures that Harry Potter has. What I did not expect was the death of Dumbledore. The concept of a magical world drew me into these books and I will stay with Harry Potter until the very end., Gosh, this book was just amazing! Like all the other Harry Potter books, I was in love. This book had a lot of background information on Lord Voldemort that is essential to understanding the series. I really am enjoying seeing Harry grow up and become more mature. Relationships start to flourish in this book, and it brings out different personalities in the characters which I like. Sadly, one of my favorite characters passes away (not gonna say who), which made me shed a few tears. (Yes I get emotional over fictional characters\\' deaths.) I can\\'t wait to start the next book in the series, I need it NOW!, The most cliffhanging., IdY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~dY~CANT BELIEVE THIS. BETRAYAL LIES AND DEATH ., Things certainly have changed at Hogwarts. New teachers and all. Ron, Hermione, and Harry all passed their O.W.L\\'s and are on to their specialties. Now that Snape is now longer Potions master, the boys can continue to study for their dream jobs as Auror\\'s. Harry is stuck using a used copy of the Potions book and discovers a book chock full of useful information about brewing potions and other spells they haven\\'t been taught. \\n Professor Dumbledore has been leaving the school for long periods and no one knows why. Harry and Professor Dumbledore start to unravel the life of Tom Riddle/Voldemort in order to figure out how to stop him. One key is hidden inside the mind of the new Potions master Horace Slughorn. Harry is tasked with getting that information. \\n At the end of this story is one of the biggest shocks in the entire series. Writing is amazing. I love this series..., \"He did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little farther along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him, the path that he and Dumbledore had set upon together, and which he now knew he would have to journey alone. There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere, and each would need to be found before there was even a possibility that Voldemort could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing them he could bring them with reach: the locket...the cup...the snake...something of Gryffindor\\'s or Ravenclaw\\'s...\" \\n Out of all the Harry Potter books that I have read so far this one has truly captivated me the most. This book contains an array of emotions that will have the reader smiling, laughing, frowning and even crying until the very end. I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed the twists and turns that the plot took. I already knew what the ending was going to bring, but even so my heart still ached. \\n \"Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.\"~Albus Dumbledore \\n I enjoyed the bonding that occurred between Harry and Dumbledore. Since the events that took place in Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix, Dumbledore decided that it would not be wise for him to distance himself from Harry and keep Harry out of the blue in regards to what is happening with the Dark Lord. Thus, in this book Dumbledore is more open with Harry and confides in him crucial information about the Dark Lord. It was remarkable to see the relationship between them grow stronger as they worked together to uncover the mysteries of Tom Riddles life. \\n It was funny seeing the romantic tension between Ron and Hermione, it is so obvious that they have feelings for each other; the question now is who will be the first one to confess. \\n I cannot hate Draco as much as I should be hating him. I have a certain theory about his character and I will see if my theory becomes true in the next book. \\n Severus Snape however has made me feel uncertain as to what his true intentions are... \\n I am very curious as to how this series is going to wrap up. There is only one book left that contains about 700+ pages. How much can really go down? What is going to be Voldemort\\'s next move? What is going to be Harry\\'s next move? What will happen with the Order of The Phoenix after this books finale? I hope to be able to answer all of these questions and much more as I move towards the 7th Harry Potter book. \\n \"Mischief Managed!\", Dumbledore\\'s death was not what I was expecting. I was shocked and had a hard time accepting it, but finding out more about Tom Riddle and the flashbacks in the pensive were an asset and helped develop a lush back story while remaining easy to follow., Awwww pure magic! What more do I need to say? Great writing and plot building! Oh and the ending destroyed me even though I knew how it ended., yah, namanya juga buku harry Potter, oke lah. I suka banget bagaimana JK Rolling menciptakan tokoh-tokoh, makhluk-makhluk, atau mantra-mantra yang keren banget. Tapi, buku ini bacanya penuh emosi. Sedih bow, I gotta say, this book surprised me. \\n The first time I read Harry Potter, the standout books (to me) were the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows. The other books seemed to be more filling, a way to get from one point to the next. \\n My first reread, I fell in love with Order of the Phoenix, and developed a grudging admiration for Prisoner of Azkaban. (By grudging admiration, I mean I rated it five stars instead of 4.5.) \\n And this reread, Half-Blood Prince is the book that wowed me. \\n Everything, from the teenage angst to the character-driven plot to the revelations at the end, seemed perfect to me. Perfectly plotted, perfectly placed. \\n I loved learning about Voldemort, about how his past shaped his future. I think I mentioned this in my Chamber of Secrets review: the parallels between Voldemort and Harry are kind of astounding. It\\'s what they did with the tragedies in their lives that truly made them into who they are. Also, I liked the idea of the prophecy - how it had no power until Voldemort gave it power. That\\'s pretty cool. \\n And I loved Harry\\'s time spent with Dumbledore, though I\\'ll admit Dumbledore\\'s constant secret-keeping and mysteriousness did get a little irksome at times. I understand he was doing it all for Harry\\'s benefit, I really do, but that was possibly my only qualm with this book. \\n I also loved Harry and Ginny . . . \\n (Margaret, don\\'t do it . . . don\\'t do it . . . GINNY WEASLEY IS A WONDERFUL CHARACTER FULL OF FIRE AND LIFE. SHE TOLD ROMILDA VANE THAT HARRY HAD A HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL TATTOO. THEIR FIRST KISS WAS IN FRONT OF AN ADORING CROWD, AFTER GINNY HAD WON THE HOUSE CUP BECAUSE HARRY HAD LANDED HIMSELF IN DETENTION. GINNY IS AWESOME AND AMAZING. How, how, how did she turn into the abysmal shadow of herself that was in the movies? Tying Harry\\'s shoes? \"Do you trust me?\" I FEEL PERSONALLY VICTIMIZED BECAUSE OF THE TAMING OF GINNY WEASLEY. Ahem. That is all.) \\n Another aspect of this novel that hit me right in my feels was Draco Malfoy. It is here that his character transcends the petty, \"my father will hear about this,\" nemesis of Harry\\'s that he serves in the earlier books. It is here that Rowling illustrates the way he is treading water in a pool that grows deeper the more he kicks. The boy is in way over his head, and that is the saddest part - he is just a boy. Just sixteen. Already being threatened by Voldemort; already serving his Dark Lord. And it is here that Harry\\'s character matures towards his schoolboy rival. He begins to pity Draco at the end, begins to see that they aren\\'t so different after all. \\n I read this book pretty quickly (as it\\'s 2:30 a.m. while I\\'m typing this review, I\\'m going to say I finished in two days) and, even though it was my third time, was completely absorbed in the reading. As such, I didn\\'t have many English-nerdy, bright analyses, but I did have a few comments. \\n -Whatever happened to the other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers? Voldemort applied for the job, presumably, about 20-30ish years before Harry went to Hogwarts. So did 20-30 teachers all just quit after a year? Did any of them die (before Quirrel)? Forget Marauders - I want a DADA teachers series. Oooooooh, now there\\'s an idea! \\n -Cormac McLaggan. That name. The more you say it/read it, the more grating it becomes. I low key spent the entire novel wanting to punch him in the face. \\n -RON SAYS \"ER-MY-NEE.\" squeal. \\n -Speaking of teenage angst, I kind of wonder whatever happened to Lavender. I despised her within the context of this narrative, of course, getting in the way of my OTP - but I think that she would have been a decent character when not affiliated with Ron. Does she die in the next book? Has J.K. Rowling released information on her future? I honestly can\\'t remember. Man, I hope she doesn\\'t die . . . \\n -Fred and George are really awesome, and I\\'m so glad Mrs. Weasley can finally see that. I\\'m just refusing to think about what happens in the next novel. Nope. \\n -Slughorn referred to Ron as Rupert. I see you, J.K. Rowling, you sly dog. I see you. \\n And, as always, some of my favorite quotes: \\n \"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly. \\n \"Yes, sir.\" \\n \"There\\'s no need to call me \"sir\" Professor.\" \\n The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. \\n SASSY HARRY IS MY FAVORITE HARRY \\n Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure. \\n Utter perfection within a single quote. \\n The thing about growing up with Fred and George,\" said Ginny thoughtfully, \"is that you sort of start thinking anything\\'s possible if you\\'ve got enough nerve. \\n LOVE GINNY. LOVE FRED AND GEORGE. LOVE THIS QUOTE. \\n _______________ \\n Ooooookay. It is time. \\n MARGARET ALYSE\\'S HARRY POTTER REREAD CRY TALLY! \\n Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone: 1 \\n Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: 0 \\n Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: 3 (!!!) \\n Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: 2 \\n Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: 2 \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: 6 \\n Yes, you read that correctly. I cried SIX FREAKING TIMES at this book. Possibly because I read it in two days. \\n 1. When Harry smelled the flowery smell from the Burrow in the Amortentia potion. Have I mentioned how much I love Harry and Ginny? \\n 2. The quote, \"It was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.\" This just . . . touched me on so many levels. And Harry was so dang awkward in response. It was adorable and I\\'m not ashamed to admit that I cried. \\n 3. When Dumbledore\\'s insisting on drinking the potion himself, and Harry is panicking. Maybe it\\'s because I knew what was coming, maybe this is a hidden gem of a scene that is often overlooked . . . but I felt that this scene really helped to solidify the relationship between Dumbledore and Harry. \\n 4. \"I am not afraid . . . I am with you.\" So many parallels . . . such a beautiful moment. \\n 5. Draco\\'s struggles when faced with Dumbledore. He\\'s just a kid, younger than I am (granted, only a year, but all the same). He\\'s so young, and being forced to kill someone - at the possible cost of his family! That is twisted and demented and wrong. \\n 6. Harry\\'s grief and shock. This dude has lost so much. So many people. And every time, he\\'s had to pick up, go on . . . he\\'s such a strong character, it\\'s frankly astounding. (Though it is interesting: Harry\\'s never been to a funeral before Dumbledore\\'s? Wow. I\\'ve been to seven, spoken at one. I\\'m not sure why this surprised me, but it did.) \\n TOTAL CRY TALLY, AS OF HALF-BLOOD PRINCE: 14 \\n Now, onto Deathly Hallows, which will probably rip my heart into little tiny shreds. Probably? Pretty much definitely., I somehow made it to 29 without encountering this book\\'s major spoiler., Great book \\n I reread this book July 2007. \\n The books are well written and I love that they get progressively darker, more intricate and grow with the reader. I almost fit perfectly into the demographic that JK Rowling writes to, but I didn\\'t start reading them until two summers ago. \\n I picked it up and couldn\\'t put it down! The story grabs you early and doesn\\'t let go, and really makes you anticipate the last book. I can\\'t wait to read Deathly Hallows to see how it all comes together., Nasil denir bilmiyorum ama, bir kitap icin en fazla bu kadar gozyasi dokulur. Bu serinin neden hayatimin serisini oldugunu bir kez daha farkettim ve anladim. Bitmesini istemedim ama elimden de dusuremedim. Onceden filmlerini izlemesem Snape\\'e karsi buyuk bir kin duyardim ama onu da yapamiyor olmam cok daha dayanilmaz. Evet, yasimi tutacagim. Cunku bir sonraki kitapta en sevdigim ve her sozunun altini cizerek okudugum adam olmayacak. \\n Serinin sonuna gececegiz artik. \\n #Lumos, I\\'ve always thought of the 6th HP book as one of my least favorite ones but reading it again now my opinion has definitely changed. Of course I\\'ve always love it but I appreciate it even more now. \\n Our precious little babies are almost all grown up now and face different problems that come with age. \\n I liked that they are battling the fact that they are in that in between area of growing up, they see them self as almost adults but the real adults still se them as kids. \\n And talking about the adults, good lord, I never thought about how much of a jerk Dumbledore is,I really disliked him in this book. He just doesn\\'t listen to anyone else and just refuses to give up information that could have really helped the cause along. I realize this is a plot devise but it just made Dumbledore seem really unsympathetic to me. \\n Anyway, What more can I say, It\\'s Harry Potter. These books had a big part in shaping who I am today, I don\\'t have anything but love for them., I don\\'t know how to rate this entry in the series. What did everyone else think of it? And why?, 11/2014, It\\'s been 7 years since I re-read the HP series, but I enjoying reading them again immensely. Oh, Sirius. Harry\\'s less influenced by Voldemort in this one, so almost back to his old self., Good book., Rereading Harry Potter is the best medicine. It\\'s been awhile since I\\'ve read this one, and it completely sucked me in as expected. \\n SO many good quotes: \\n (84) Possibly taking his watery eyes for emotion at the news. (little quips like this keep it funny) \\n (96) \"Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.\" \\n (139) Luna\\'s knack for embarrassing honesty. \\n (165) \"That\\'s not saying much, seeing as you\\'re already dead,\" Ron observed. \"Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,\" said nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the Dead end of the gryffindor table. \\n (192) Caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn\\'s dungeon. \\n (197) \"Being- forgive me- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger\" \\n (290) No... He would have to control that particular brotherly feeling... \\n (384) Everyone looked around furtively to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. \\n (405) Hagrid\\'s familiar guilty expression. \\n (422) \"And if Dobby does it wrong, Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower, Harry POtter!) \\n (510) \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! \\n Love that in the middle of the wizarding war, their grades still matter. It\\'s all those small things. Trevor still trying to get away. Fleur and Bill\\'s relationship. Keeps it all relatable. Also little things like Lupin suggesting Hary checking the date of the book even though that doesn\\'t end up helping. Terry Boot even asks Slughorn why people don\\'t use Felix Felicis all the time, answering questions like that (unlike when they don\\'t answer why people don\\'t use time turners more, why Dumbledore wouldn\\'t use the lucky potion, etc). Harry tried to good naturedly help Hermione with her potion. So much like a teenager avoiding making arrangements with Snape concerning the suspension. The transformations in the stories are so good- Harry\\'s different theories. \\n I have always loved that she makes us think that Ron drank the potion. \\n Couple questions: \\n Seems like Snape would require an O in Defense Against teh Dark Arts just like he did in Potions. \\n They always talk about wizards being terrible at Muggle clothes but the kids in the movies are so good at it. \\n Why do their own owls bring incoming mail? \\n If Hannah Abbotts Mom had been found dead, wouldn\\'t that be in the newspaper? \\n INteresting that Dumbledore would go personally explain to Tom Riddle but not Harry Potter. \\n Not fair- Malfoy was going to use Crucio! \\n All around upsetting that when typing out a note on my phone or texting, my phone automatically corrects \"Voldemort\".. my phone should know better. \\n Also couldn\\'t help think about how Merope couldn\\'t perform magic around her abusive father, just like kids who are being abused can\\'t learn, function, etc. \\n I know that the books transition into being less about school but I miss reading about the classes and their classmates, like Nevill, and the things they are learning. I lost it in this book in the death scene at the end, knowing what we know in the 7th book about snape. Also love Fleur\\'s devotion to Bill., Hard to comment on this book without giving anything away so I will just say that it was a wild ride from start to finish. Although Harry continues to irritate me, I am completely invested in the all the other characters in the series (even the so-called evil villains like Malfoy and Snape). I loved all the little romances that really started blossoming in this one--I know that was a backstory, but my favorite part for sure! Can\\'t wait to read #7!, Brilliant as every HP book!, re-read in prep for book 7 (7/29/07), loved it. JK Rowling does not disappoint., I continue to be amazed that these books are written with a target audience of kids 9-12 years. The length and intricacy of the plots seem much more geared towards teens and adults. That said, the continuing elements of magic and the wizarding world provides an excellent backdrop for all readers to sit back and enjoy. \\n The Half-Blood Prince was more of a keystone novel in the series than a stand-alone book. It seemed to set the tone for the coming final book, introducing key plot points and characters while failing to produce a complete, \"here\\'s the start and here\\'s the finish\" book of its own. What it does, for the overall series, is perfectly poise the reader for book seven. \\n Without spoiling things, my biggest complaint about this book is the pivotal death that occurs. As mentioned before, I\\'m more of a happily ever after kind of writer (and reader). This was a shocking and devastating element to the novel that I could have done without., Great, as always!, Essa serie e toda minuciosamente calculada! A J.K. criou esse mundo de uma forma tao completa e complexa que me deixa embasbacada! A forma como os personagens vao crescendo e amadurecendo em cada livro, e a narrativa, o universo bruxo e a complexidade da historia vao crescendo junto... e inacreditavel. A melhor coisa que eu fiz ate hoje na minha vida adulta foi reler esses livros. TODAS as pessoas da terra deveriam ler esses livros! E impossivel para qualquer ser humano, de qualquer idade, nao gostar e nao se impressionar com esses livros. Comeco a releitura do livro sete agora, ja triste porque a saga esta acabando., Okay this was not bad butttttttt \\n Harry is a very stereotypical boy when it comes to Ginny and I\\'m disappointed., The book is a million times better than the film., \"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\", This book containes irony, social comment, humour, complexity, warmth, wit, humour, subplots, the big picture and many more things that were completely missing in the film. After watching the monumnentally dull movie, I just reread the book to see what had been left out, and why. \\n I suppose there are time constraints and technical issues I know wot of, but much of the humour is visual. \\n \\'...said Ron, casually turfing a first-year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. \\'The curse...\\' \\n \\'You\\'re right,\\' said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first-year again. \\'It ...\\' \\n Surely the actors could do this kind of thing without holding up the plot? The acting was like that in a soap opera - all breathing and blinking. Very dull. \\n Were they trying to make everyone nice? In the movie Professor Slughorn asks Hagrid if he can take some valuable venom from the dead body of Hagrid\\'s beloved spider. In the book he steals it sneakily. A tiny change, but millions of these tiny changes have the effect of not airbrushing so much as smearing over the author\\'s vision, so you lose what made the book outstanding., ABSOLUTELY AMAZING <3 no other words. =], Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Reviewed from the Perspective of Structural Analysis in regard to the Arc of the Series as a Whole (Spoiler Alert) - my thoughts on the screenplay, film and novel with regard to the relationship between Harry and Snape \\n I am in awe of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince for J.K. Rowling\\'s brilliantly crafted parallelism and structure that drive both the novel and screenplay. Harry and Snape are incredibly parallel in this book, almost like brothers, without Harry realizing it. Not only is Harry using Snape\\'s spell book without realizing it, but both Snape and Harry obey Dumbledore\\'s orders to force their beloved mentor, friend and father figure to do unpleasant but necessary things, after having given Dumbledore their word on it. Harry forces Dumbledore to drink the poison that will help them find a horcrux, even lying to get Dumbledore to finish the ten cups of it, unwittingly aiding in the progression of Dumbledore\\'s demise, and Snape performs the mercy killing that saves Dumbledore from an excruciating death from the curse on his hand. Both Harry and Snape have the integrity to live up to their word and the courage to put Dumbledore\\'s plan for the greater good ahead of the deep emotional pain it causes them to see Dumbledore suffer, knowing they are playing a role in that suffering. Snape would rather die as a result of choosing not to kill Dumbledore, than go through with killing the only living person who truly knows him. In spite of the unbreakable vow he took on Dumbledore\\'s instructions, the promise to Draco\\'s mother that he would help and protect Draco and kill Dumbledore himself if Draco does not succeed, under penalty of death for failure, Snape still tells Dumbledore, \"You ask too much. You take too much for granted.\" Snape argues with his mentor and ensures that Dumbledore knows the stakes of what he is asking, yet ultimately follows through reliably and with love. The information is cleverly presented to readers in a way that can be interpreted to suggest that Snape could be serving either Voldemort or The Order of the Phoenix. There are plot points in every key section that suggest that Snape is on the right side, without entirely revealing it, though they are presented as debate. \\n Snape and Harry are paradoxically blinded by prejudice against one another. Harry is not perfect in this novel and that makes him relatable. Harry makes mistakes. He uses The Half Blood Prince\\'s spell for enemies to seriously wound Draco, bringing a bewildered look from Snape, who quickly saves the other student, as Harry guiltily backs away. Harry\\'s justified hatred of Snape, who bullied him for resembling his father, Snape\\'s own bully, causes Harry to miss all the cues from all those he trusts that Snape is essentially on his side in the big picture of the war in the wizarding world. From Hermione frowning at Harry\\'s wish for Snape\\'s death in act one, to his family friend warning him near midpoint that he is blinded by hatred, to Harry missing all of Dumbledore\\'s clues that Dumbledore has absolute solid reason to trust Snape, Harry is forgivably human. He\\'s had too much bullying from the dark arts professor to want to see him as anything other an absolute enemy. In spite of all the clever clues to the truth beneath the surface, readers are likely to go along with the protagonist\\'s theories that the aging Dumbledore can make mistakes and that the double agent Snape could be working for the evil wizard Voldemort. It\\'s my favourite book in the series for the way it fuelled my hope that Snape would be on Harry\\'s side before the last book came out and for how well Snape and Harry\\'s parallel character arcs are constructed. It sets up a beautiful crossover when the full backstory of Snape\\'s character is revealed in the last novel, allowing Harry to move into wholeness through forgiveness and compassion., Knowing what was coming in the end didn\\'t soften the blow enough to keep the tears at bay., If I haven\\'t watch the movies, I might despise Snape as much as Harry. I hate it when a good character died instead of the bad one. Sems that they taken Felix juice Often to have that long lasting luck. Should have known the potion book belonged to Snape from the very begining., Five stars for all the Harry Potters. So imaginative, and pure page-turning delight., More re-reading, and I\\'m almost full up with HPness. On the other hand, I think this is my new favorite of the last 3 books - more depth, the whole Harry-is-right-Malfoy-is-Up-to-Something plot, and more pieces I didn\\'t quite remember from previous readings. The entire funeral scene is stuck so hard and so visually in my head, I am always startled that all the things that happen in the book don\\'t happen in the movie., Do I really need to say anything of this book? Part of the best series of all time, if you are the only reader on the planet to have not yet devoured it, make sure you get your copy asap!, Because I\\'m dyslexic it takes me a long time to read it, I loved it all., Half-Blood Prince is the best HP book, fight me., This is probably the first time I\\'ve cried while listening to a book. There\\'s something intoxicating in the way Stephen Fry narrates and the whole section with Harry and Dumbledore in the caves was so emotional that I couldn\\'t help but shed a tear at Dumbledore\\'s desperate cries for help. I remember when I was first reading this book, I\\'d been really shocked to discover Dumbledore\\'s death. However, that feeling was nothing compared to what I felt when Fry\\'s pleading voice of Dumbledore echoed through my ears. I felt shattered once again. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore - you will be missed!, Of course, I give 5 stars! I really loved this book, now the second best from the HP series for me:-) \\n This book was so emotional. It is all about growth. It\\'s about the growth of Harry into a young man who will be ready to take on the tough tasks ahead of him. It\\'s also about the growth of Voldemort into the most powerful dark wizard of all time. I grew up on Harry Potter movies, so I\\'ve already knew what\\'s going to happened in the book, but THIS? These were so many emotions! \\n I don\\'t think this book needs a long review, so I\\'ll say just this. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO READ THIS, so if you haven\\'t read HP books yet, you must! \\n P.S. I love you, J.K Rowling!;-), Uno de los mejores libros de la saga, no por el contenido en si, si no por todos los sucesos que van ocurriendo a lo largo de la trama que producen que no quieras despegar tu nariz del ebook. \\n He acabado encantada con la historia, la trama, los personajes y todo lo que pueda decirse. \\n La trama me atrapo desde el primer momento y como siempre me tuvo haciendo suposiciones desde el principio hasta el final. Lo mejor de todo es que para nada me esperaba todo lo que ocurre al final de la trama, por lo que ademas de dejarme impactada, me dejo satisfecha porque me sorprendio y cuando no te esperas las escenas, significa que el libro es bueno. \\n Los personajes se notan que poco a poco van adquiriendo su personalidad y aqui podemos ver el cambio de actitud de mucho de ellos, algunos me han encantado, pero otros siempre siguen la misma linea, cosa que no me gusto del todo. \\n Para mi es uno de los mejores libros, y creo que es debido al enganche que tengo por la saga que hace que cada libro me guste mas y mas. \\n La autora en este libro se ha volcado al cien por cien y por fin puedo decir que es exactamente el tipo de escritora que me gusta. \\n Ha habido escenas en las que he reido, me he quejado, he querido chillar y hasta me han dado mucha pero que mucha pena, y eso es lo bueno de los libros. Los libros cuando cambian tu estado de animo se puede decir con total libertad que son buenos. \\n Como siempre se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo y a aquellos que nunca le han dado una oportunidad, les invito a que lo hagan como hice yo, porque sinceramente quede encantada!, I did y\\'all a favor and rewrote page 596., Amazing every time., I was pleasantly surprised that this was such a good book. I don\\'t think I have ever given a harry potter book more than 3 stars., So much better than five. Great book, I knew it had to happen but I wish it wasn\\'t so!, Awesome as always!!, I think my heart just broke., ** spoiler alert ** \\n He still dies; it still hurts; my heart is still broken. However, to have such friends. \\n Can I have a pensive?, I like this book for some of the side stories that it showed. And for the greater understanding and compassion I got for Malfoy. However, it was also a very frustrating book. So I waffled between two and three stars for this one. On the plus side some of my favorite characters finally hooked up., my fave after first one, Re-read: September 2015, The first 300 pages were slow and boring. Too much recap - get on with it. But the end was awesome, with a good Empire Strikes Back-esque cliff-hanger. There needed to be a scene of Harry and girlfriend Ginny interacting before they fell in love, but hey, it worked. My prediction after reading: In the next book, Harry will discover that the horocrux locket was taken by Regulus Black, left in 12 Grimmald Place, then taken by Mundungus and sold. Oh, and Bellatrix has another horocrux., good., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I forgot how much I love this book. From sassy Harry to the dark themes. I love how final Harry\\'s childhood feels by the end of this book. He realizes now more than ever that he has to go on this important mission no matter what. \\n I cannot wait to start the final book., Superb. It was this book that began to really connect all the various thoughts for me. Rowling is masterful at withholding secrets and creating a magical world. This one broke my heart., Probably the best one in the series. Movie\\'s a different story..., Read July 2012 \\n Re-read July 25-Aug 8 2013. This one is probably my favorite in the series, because the character become more than just cardboard cutouts; especially Dumbledore! Ron is as annoying and useless as ever. The part where Dumbledore... you know. Still as effecting as the first time I read it, my heart pounding, hoping for a miracle. Just re-reading it with the understanding of the hatred and revulsion on Snape\\'s face as he does it, it\\'s so moving. I don\\'t understand why people like Malfoy so much. Ok, yeah, he didn\\'t have the desire or the guts to kill Dumbledore, but if it weren\\'t for extraordinary good luck, he would have killed two other people. And he and his parents don\\'t necessarily like the consequences of being evil and befriending a soulless murderer; well gee, cry me a river. I don\\'t like the Malfoys, and I am annoyed that people find them so awesome when they ARE NOT. THEY ARE JERKS. \\n Re-read Aug 2014 Reread this, this time with my 10 year old as he read it for the first time. I was struck with Rowlings ability to show things a bit at a time or not at all. From this book, you would not expect anything that happens in the 7th. That is amazing to me. There\\'s just so much MORE to the story and you think you will know how it goes and you don\\'t at all. There are some very subtle things through the first books and #5 that you can only notice after you\\'ve read #7, it\\'s a lot of fun to see that. I do love this book. \\n Re-read Aug 2015. I told Josh I would buy him a butterscotch beer if he re-read the Harry Potter series with me over the summer break. He\\'s beat me to the finish, as he\\'s done with #7 as I\\'m finishing this one. It\\'s a great read, as usual, but I can\\'t understand why Dumbledore didn\\'t tell Harry he was dying and he asked Snape to kill him. Surely he realized what might happen when they came back to Hogwarts; even if not in that moment, sometime in the near future Dumbledore knew what Snape would do. Why, why didn\\'t he tell Harry. It\\'s completely irrelevant to the tasks Harry was given. It seems like he only didn\\'t tell him because PLOT, but it doesn\\'t do anything for the plot. It struck me as very annoying. \\n Re-read Jul 08, 2017 Fun re-read, still sad., 0.5: The Prequel: 4 \\n 1. Philosopher\\'s Stone: 4 \\n 2. Chamber of Secrets: 5 \\n 3. Prisoner of Askaban: 5 \\n 4. Goblet of Fire: 4 \\n 5. Order of the Phoenix: 5 \\n 6. Half-blood Prince: 5 \\n 7. Deathly Hallows: 5 \\n 8: Cursed Child: 3, I feel crazy for even trying to talk about this without giving away any spoilers. Granted, I\\'m sure most people know ALL about Harry Potter and the major event that occurs at the end of this one. :) And if you don\\'t know-then either read it or watch the movie!!! Ya\\'ll are missing out. \\n I love this series. I\\'m surprised it has taken me so long to re-read it! I was expecting to see the writing become somewhat trivial and nothing special. However, it just sucked me in. While taken at face value, I\\'m sure it\\'s fairly basic. Once it is all combined and the characters are involved, it certainly turns magical. \\n Harry has certainly grown, which is understandable given all that he has gone through. He doesn\\'t act so much as a whiny kid like he used to. He is truly invested in securing his future at this point. Ron seemed to bloom as well. He really stepped out from behind Harry and became his own person. Same thing with Hermione-she starts to grow as a person and is more trusting. She opens up to her friends in ways she never did before. \\n Overall, we see just how much the wizarding world has changed since the first book. Everyone is much more grown up and facing more intense situations. I already know what happens in the next, but I still can\\'t wait to read it again and experience the conclusion to all this chaos., Though I\\'ve read all but the first HP (the last two twice), this is my favorite. It reminds me of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" in the Star Wars movie series. There\\'s something about the anticipation in this book when we see the possibility of Harry Potter\\'s demise. It\\'s the turning point. No more will Harry return happily to Hogwarts to riddle out the evil in this perfect, magical world. This book reminds us of the real mortality of our beloved friends (Dumbledore) and that Harry\\'s world, though fantasy, does mirror our own just a bit. Definitely five stars!, Better than book five, to be sure, Harry Potter books, my favourite to my least favourite (in my opinion- though they are all perfection) \\n 1. Half Blood Prince \\n 2. Goblet of Fire \\n 3. Prisoner of Azkaban \\n 4. Deathly Hallows \\n 5. Chamber of Secrets \\n 6. Philosopher\\'s Stone \\n 7. Order of Phoenix, ** spoiler alert ** \\n This is my personal favorite book of the series because you finally learn more about Voldemort\\'s past and because of that kiss with Ginny (that they RUINED in the movie). The lessons with Dumbledore and the discovery of why Voldemort is the way that he is (and how he survived since Lilly and James\\' deaths) are exciting and satisfying. Harry is really becoming a man in this book., My Favorite one!!, How can you possibly make a book about magic so boring? This should have been called Massive Plot Dumps with Dumbledore instead., This is probably my favorite ...... oh wait. That\\'s so hard to decide. I love this book though. This one and number 3 are my favorites to reread, probably because of all the teenage romance and because up until the climax, the pacing is a little more relaxed. I love the end of this one. She makes some daring moves that are always a pleasure to read., Good ending, however things did all end up tied in a little bow. Will be really interesting to see if J.K can write anything else., I loved it. Page turner., \"Out of all the novels in this series, this one is my favorite one. I love just the overall plot, how it is played, and just everything about this novel from The Slug Club, Horace Slughorn, the jealousy among certain characters in this novel, Ron Weasley trying out for the Quidditch Team, the twin\\'s prank shop. and of course the Half-Blood Prince. Also, this is the darkest novel out of all the novels Rowling has written especially since it puts a lot emphasis on Severus Snape and the the task given to Draco Malfoy as he is inducted as a Deatheater. \\n This novel as brings in the reason behind the immortality or supposed immortality Voldemort has as well as the task given to Album Dumbledore and Harry Potter. This novel seemed to be more of a mission-based novel and I really enjoyed reading that is it reminded me a lot of per se Ender\\'s Game or anything similar to those writings by Orson Scott Card. I have to admit since this novel is the darkest novel it is such a different pace for Rowling and thus a big up from her last novel. As always I must agree that people must follow the direction of the novel releases and would not consider this as a stand-alone novel to read.\", I loved this. Why did it take me so long to get to these books? I\\'ve moved on to #7 now....too bad I still have to start from the beginning., fantastic., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I\\'m reading through the Harry Potter series for the first time, and \"Half Blood Prince\" might be one of my favorite books in the series to date. Yes, it\\'s dark, but considering everything that\\'s happened, life in Harry\\'s world can\\'t stay too optimistic forever. For me, there wasn\\'t much about this book to dislike; in fact, the only part that felt contrived was Harry\\'s newfound relationship with Ginny. Yes, we\\'ve seen that she\\'s had a crush on him for a while, but his feelings for her seem to come out of nowhere (especially since he was crushing on Cho in the last few books). \\n Anyhow, the whole book builds up to the final chapters, which are well written. I will say that I incorrectly guessed who the Prince was, so the revelation was an unexpected but enjoyable swerve., I bawled like a baby in the last pages. This was the most emotionally touching book of the series. I am not a huge Dumbledore fan but his death marks the end of an era! \\n Also Snape - poor, poor Snape! \\n Malfoys find out that anyone can be victims of the dark side, irrespective of blood status. Not feeling so good about it now, are you? \\n Dear (sexist jerk) Ron, Ginny is not your property. Nor is Hermione. Both can do whatever they like in their lives. So please stop acting like an entitled prick. Is that clear? Yes? Thank you. \\n Dear Tonks, get over it already! There are many fish in the sea. \\n Well, that\\'s all. I just wish I hadn\\'t given the other books 5 stars because this definitely merits a higher rating., The feels are real!, JK Rowling\\'s ability to render maturity over a long story arc is remarkable. Her ability to do it with a somewhat limited palette appropriate to a juvenile reading audience is truly a gift since growing up in the eyes of the many writers lacking creativity means profanity and promiscuity. Instead, her cast alternately noble and surly, in other words, adolescent. Her Harry has an increasing sense of his own identity and a willingness to stand up to those who encroach upon it. \\n Because the author has invested a lot of time even in secondary characters, the action as she navigates the plot is intense and gripping., Harry Potter is back for his 6thh year taking personal lessons from Dumbledore and learning background information on Lord Voldemort so he can fight him. Voldemort and his Death eaters are attempting to seize power. The end of the book has a climatic fight at the astronomy tower., 4.5 Stopping HP after suffering through book 5 was one of my worst decisions ever., Harry\\'s story, always wonderful, takes on a more serious meaning in this sixth book. Lord Voldemort is rising and gathering followers, and Professor Dumbledore recruits Harry to take on an even more challenging role in stopping the Dark Lord. At the same time, hormones are sweeping through Hogwarts like wildfire and Mr. Potter must deal with the normal trials of being a teenager along with his heroic destiny. All Potter fans must read this book., It was interesting knowing the ending to go back and re-read. Snape\\'s treachery was more obvious. Malfoy became much more sympathetic, and Harry being sucked in to the book seemed much more silly. But now even though its only been a few days its already starting to fade from my mind. I thought the scene with Dumbledore drinking the potion was hard, I found his death more upsetting the second time. It was enjoyable but I still felt that Voldemort should have been doing more.alf-Blood Prince, I first read this on a plane on my way home from the US ages ago. I\\'d completely forgotten half the stuff that happened in it, it\\'s a very detailed volume of Harry that starts to piece together all the info Harry has collated over the last 6 years., Second to least favorite of the 7, but still so good and that ENDING. #6, Amazing, first his dad, then his mum, then his godfather- Siruis Black, now Dumbledore whom he counted as the most powerful(est) wizard around. nothing left to do but surge forward with people he treasures the most: Ron, and Hermoine. \\n i cant take it!!!! he dumped Ginny because of that i agree to his decision but no you DONT DUMP THE PERSON U LOVE MORE THAN UR LIFE!!! \\n (inhales) okay now I NEED TO READ THE LAST BOOK!!! THE SUSPENSE ID KILLING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, It doesn\\'t matter how many times I\\'ve read this, I still cry every single time., Harry Potter will always be my favorite book series. I have read these books over 10 times and I can say that even though it has been over 10 years since I have read the first book, I still can relate to these amazing characters. These books changed my life for the better. Jo Rowling, you are my hero :), REREADING, Wow... I\\'m in total shock and denial right now..., im so angry dumbldore died, i just love harry potter and his attitude beside his luck :D., Loved it - I cried and cried at the end., I\\'m devastated :(, Loving these books!!, Lots of little snippets of stuff from previous books keep popping up, which I quite enjoy. But apart from that not that much really happens., I was shocked, sad and very mad at the end of the book!!! But I loved it, I guess that would be my favorite book of all the 7, it was magical! I cried a lot in the end too, but in book 7 things got better after I understood some stuff., I refuse to write reviews for these books because there is just too much epic awesomeness for me to do it justification. Just read it, damnit., I read this book again. It was awesome as ever. I cried just as hard at the end as I did last time., It is a big surprise, that Rowling make Dumbledore die!! Unpredictable!, My favorite book of the harry potter\\'s one, Loved every bit of it the second time round again!, Wow...., great! sad! I cried!, Another amazing installment to the Harry Potter series. Be prepared for darker themes, trials, and some sad events. I cannot wait for the next installment. It has been a pleasure to grow older and wiser with Harry Potter., like always that was wonderful,perfect,fantastic,...... \\n i love magic and harry potter is one of the best magic books in the world, Still sobbing from last night. My heart. dY~<<dY~<<dY~<< full spoiler review will go up on my channel in about a week. YT/purposeful pursuits, The salve to the wound that is book 5 and by far my favorite. I am not a sci-fi person and so surprised by how invested I had become with these books. Year 6, 16-years-old, brings the drama and romance that I usually look for in a book. LOVE IT!, Just WOW!! I love this book so much! By far my favorite book in the series! Everything about it is just perfect! 5 out of 5!, Gotta reread this in preparation for the movie!, absolutely loved this book. properly the best so far out of the Harry potter series. can not believe it has taken me so long to pick these books up. honestly love the books as much as the films. properly ever a little bit more. \\n I love how in the book the charecters grow up a little bit more and develop love interest. Such an amazing read!!!, Started this series...for the first time...at the beginning of the summer. Almost there! Not surprised at all that this series is being used as a text in some college classes...there\\'s a lot in there., HOW COULD SHE KILL DUMBLEDORE?! HOW COULS SHE?!!!, \"I am the Half-blood prince\". \\n Read to find out who said this!!! You\\'ll NEVER (:)) guess! Second reading impressed me more. Ms. Rowling really had a huge arcing vision and I\\'m amazed again at what she crafted. Well done., I listened to this on an audio disc in my car. Harry is a great companion., As the saga of teen wizard Harry Potter winds toward the climactic seventh year, JK Rowling seems to have found her footing with this book better than the previous two. By eliminating most of the extraneous subplots with which she cluttered earlier books, she\\'s told a fast-moving, streamlined tale of a grim sixth year for Harry and his friends. One of the best books in the series. \\n A warning: where the earlier books were targeted at younger teens, by now the series has grown pretty dark and grim, and there are some parts in here that would be disturbing for younger readers., This book never ceased to amaze me. What a complex labyrinth Rowling composed when writing this book!, OUTSTANDING!!! The story is soo detail oriented..Truly spectacular., Probably the worst Harry Potter book, but that doesn\\'t say much., sad, sophisticated and stunning, I got confused about the reference about \"the Half-Blood prince\" after I watched the movie but upon reading the book, it was clear to me is that the \"Prince\" title was not a title at all. \\n Overall it its now action pack and it becomes a set up to the final showdown on the 7th and final book., Good book in the series but not my favorite... Don\\'t want to give away any spoilers away, so I\\'ll just say that I really didn\\'t like the way it ended... \\n The first half of the book was amazing... For me, I found that the fact that nobody ever believes Harry makes no sense at all... It seems this is repeated in every book... I mean it\\'s been 6 years now and he is always right, I don\\'t get why he doesn\\'t have more credibility..., In preparation for the seventh book\\'s release!, Re-read!, All I can say is, Harry has always added a kind of light to my life that would never and by no means been there if it wasn\\'t for him. These stories are everything to me., Amazingly, I haven\\'t read this book in almost four years. Yet, hands down, it\\'s still my favorite in the Harry Potter series, and it the reason why I keep rereading the books. \\n This particular Harry Potter book is the best-written of the series, especially when it comes down to the sentences. (My suspicion is that Rowling got quite a bit of flak about the excessive wordiness of Order of the Phoenix and, therefore, actually concentrated on the phrasing in this book.) There are still far too many ellipses in use in all of the Harry Potter books, but other than that the dialog is sharp and the word choice crisp and precise. \\n My favorite chapter is twenty-three, the one in which Dumbledore explains to Harry why he must fight Voldemort: \"But [Harry:] understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew--and so do I , thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents--that there was all the difference in the world.\" That quote, to me, pretty much sums up the entire series, and I\\'m glad Rowling finally penned such a superb summary statement. \\n This book also doesn\\'t suffer from lapses of logic or plot holes the size of Hogwarts (the latter of which can be found in abundance in the last Harry Potter book), and readers\\' questions are (for the most part, so we think) answered as much as possible at the book\\'s conclusion. Characters stay in character (a trait that, happily, is Rowling\\'s strength throughout the series) and action moves at a steady pace, gaining momentum as the ends looms nearer, of course. \\n This book is so satisfying that it\\'s no wonder I was slightly disappointed by the final one; if the penultimate book is the best, what can one do except push through the final one doggedly in order to find out, finally, what exactly will happen in the end?, I wasn\\'t planning on writing a review for the Harry Potter books, because I\\'m sure everybody already knows the story (and how good it is), but I -just- finished reading book 6 again and I\\'m surprised at what happened to me ... \\n I didn\\'t cry when \\'it\\' happened, maybe because I knew it was coming and I was waiting for it to happen (I still remember the utter shock when I read this book for the first time), but I did cry several times reading the last 100 pages or so. \\n I cried when Fleur asked Mrs Weasly if she thought Bill wasn\\'t going to love her anymore after what had happened. And I cried when the Phoenix was singing its magical song. And I cried when the mermaid people were singing, and the centaurs shot arrows into the air. I cried when Hagrid was crying. \\n This is such a good story., one shock after another, then a waterfall of tears, It\\'s really hard to pick my favorite book from the Harry Potter series but this one might be it. The history of Voldemort that Harry learns with Dumbledore is really interesting (I just kept wanting more of those story arcs). A lot of crazy stuff happens in this book and it keeps you interested the entire time., good book, Huh. Apparently listening to Dumbledore\\'s death makes me cry too..., Kept me guessing until the end., I like that the characters are well-established. We know who they are. They can (and do) come and go. They have interesting back-stories. Hagrid always has something going on. Ron is struggling with his identity at school and as Harry\\'s friend. Hermione still wants peace and justice in the world. Malfoy is a ghostly presence, having pretty much given up on tormenting Harry and the gang and battling problems way bigger that he is. Rowling is ingenious. Vanishing cabinets, horcruxes and pensieves...she takes it all on and makes us believe! I also love that the characters are not black or white. Sometimes they are good, sometimes they are so humanly weak. All of their ambitions and desires are recognizable. \\n One of the highlights of this book is Luna commentating on the Quiddich match. Go, Luna! \\n One of the most heartbreaking moments; Harry reassures Dumbledore at the horcrux lake; \"Don\\'t worry, professor.\" And Dumbledore replies; \"I\\'m not worried. I\\'m with you.\" \\n This one ends with one of the most excruciating cliff-hangers ever. How can there be any hope in the world without Dumbledore? And Snape a traitor? Bleak indeed., ** spoiler alert ** \\n U,U,,O\"US OSSU,,OuOoUSO+- U,,OSS USOaOU...U,, dY\\'\"dY\\'\" \\n RIP Dumbledore dY\\'\"dY\\'\", Loved it. \\n J.K. Rowling has done wonders with this book. One of my favorites in the series., fav <3, Loved it! :\\'), Me parece un libro mas maduro que los anteriores. Y me gusto mas que la vez anterior... que me precio tan re fome. Ahora incluso lo leeria de nuevo., Whoa, ok. No snark, all impressions. \\n My impressions: \\n -Called it again. But this time more :( \\n -Cho was a ho, and so is Ginny? Wait--what? Where did this come from? \\n -Horcruxes are reminding me of when Link has to collect the pendents to get the master sword and then you get taken to the dark world to get the seven crystals and it gets a lot less fun from there in Link to the Past. Will the next book be less fun? Probably. \\n -Never trust a book that has handwritten instructions. Shoulda learned from that diary. \\n -Why was Malfoy allowed back at Hogwarts at all this year? \\n -She\\'s really gotten bored with Quidditch at this point, huh? \\n -And the food and candy \\n -I want a Pensieve. \\n -Snape IS A BUNGHOLE. I was wrong to doubt my original assessment. Or was I? I have a feeling his story is far from over. A missing piece. Haven\\'t worked it out mentally. \\n Well, one more to go. She shed the over detail long craze of books four and five, and got more to the point with this one. I expect more of the same for the last installment. Here I go..., This series has gone from \"Middle grade drama, boring,\" to \"highschool drama, boring\" to \"OH MY GOODNESS THEY\\'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!\" Talk about escalating quickly! That said... \\n Albus Dumbledore is an idiot. A likable, wise, clever, noble idiot, but an idiot nonetheless. Harry Potter is also an idiot, but he\\'s only sixteen so he may be excused. One top of all that though I had some serious issues with the plot of this one. \\n SPOILER ALERTS \\n You really mean to tell me that after all this time and conflict over whether or not Snape is a good guy or a bad guy he turns out to be....a bad guy? That Harry Potter the emotional teenager is a better judge of character than the old and wise Dumbledore? That Dumbledore\\'s ironclad reason for trusting Snape was...nonexistent? I think being a triple agent would have been way cooler. Also, none of Dumbledore\\'s friends in all of this time managed to get him to tell them the ironclad reason why he trusted Snape? I mean....COME ON. Show some intelligence! \\n I was disappointed that the riddle of the half-blood prince ultimately ended up having nothing whatsoever to do with the plot. It was a fasinating subplot and very well developed but unlike all the previous books the tie-in was sort of contrived. I had narrowed down the identity of the half-blood prince to either Snape or Voldemort by about a third of the way through the book, and I had hoped that when Harry found out who it was he would realize that a) perhaps Snape isn\\'t that bad or b) even Voldemort can appear to be a good guy. \\n Really upset about Snape. I thought for sure they had some really, really clever loophole for that unbreakable oath thing., Book 6 is now tied with Book 5 for my favorite of the series!, I love Harry!, Cried through the last two chapters, per usual., This was my first revisit of book six since it came out. My heart aches worse than ever before., Again, I have been spellbound by Rowling\\'s writing style. I love how she follows the great writing traditions of other English greats. If you love fantasy and being enrapt in another world, then you will love this series. With Rowling\\'s wicked sense of humor and vivid narrative, Hogwarts and its occupants come alive and I found myself unable to put it down and thinking about it after I had. I just love getting lost in a story and Rowling makes it easy., Still cried at Dumbledore\\'s funeral., Acercandose al final de la saga de Harry Potter este libro contiene menos accion que los anteriores, pero a cambio de eso nos ofrece mas emocion y corazon de todos los personajes. \\n Despues de los eventos ocurridos el ano anterior, Dumbledore decide poner en practica un plan para detener definitivamente a Lord Voldemort y, corrigiendo sus decisiones anteriores, involucra mas a Harry en el. \\n Hasta aqui el resumen del libro. Mi primera recomendacion es que no lean resumenes, porque gran parte de lo interesante que tiene es el ir descubriendo la trama conforme se va avanzando. Mientras menos sepan mas disfrutaran de los misterios que se iran revelando: quien es el principe mestizo, quien es el nuevo maestro de Defensa contra las Artes Oscuras, que nuevas clases tendran que tomar Harry y sus amigos, cual es el plan de Dumbledore, como haran para detener a Voldemort, etc. etc. \\n Definitivamente a esta alturas Harry Potter ha dejado de ser una lectura para ninos. Harry ha dejado de ser un nino tambien, y ahora participa mas activamente en la lucha contra su mortal enemigo. Todos los personajes han pasado por experiencias muy dificiles y han ido creciendo conforme a ellas, de manera que vemos emociones y sentimientos mas intensos. Se toma demasiado tiempo en la vida de Voldemort, pero es a proposito para equilibrarlo con el ultimo libro que gira en la vida de Dumbledore. \\n J.K. Rowling ha dicho que ella no lo ve como una historia aparte, sino como la primera de dos partes, y eso se siente en toda la trama. Las cosas no avanzan tan rapido como acostumbran en otros libros de Harry Potter, y son mas los misterios que quedan en el aire. Se trata del preambulo que establece las bases del gran final de la serie. \\n En lo que respecta al final del libro, que sorprendera a muchos, pienso que resulta ser el mas adecuado para lo que la autora quiere de Harry Potter, aunque resulte dificil de asimilar, por el carino que hemos llegado a sentir por todos los personajes (un personaje importante hace un sacrificio enorme ... para mi gusto el mejor personaje de toda la saga). \\n Un libro cargado de sorpresas para todos los fans y con el final mas emotivo de toda la serie. \\n Mejora mucho con respecto al libro pasado. Se toma demasiado tiempo en la vida de Voldemort, pero es a proposito para equilibrarlo con el ultimo libro que gira en la vida de Dumbledore. La solucion del conflicto se complica mucho, y un personaje importante hace un sacrificio enorme (para mi gusto el mejor personaje de toda la saga). Excelente primer acto de un gran final., Wandered a little in the middle, but picked up strongly at the end. \\n I put this into the young adult fiction, the subject matter was a little more mature, This book was OK. Not up to the standards set by the last 5 novels. Rushed and lacking in true emotion. Better known in fandom as \"Harry Potter and the Half-Baked Plot\"., Me lo esperaba. El final me lo esperaba, era TAN obvio... La trama decepcionante pero #romione y #hinny me encantaron, ALL THE FEELS OMG, There was minimal action but when the Dark Mark rose, all hell broke lose in the final chapters... \\n I actually loved Slughorn and his character was awesomely descriptive! Draco was just annoying and I see very little redeeming factors. The mystery of the \\'Half Blood Prince and his book was intriguing. The meetings with Dumbledore were also interesting and the brief snippets into the history of You-Know-Who kept my attention. Love was in the air absolutely everywhere but I know things will change between now and the series finale, at least Harry seems to have his love life sorted... \\n Oh, and also, how sad was the ending. R.I.P., I cried long after I finished this book. It was even more moving and captivating than the last one. This is definitely my favourite book in the series so far!, My second favorite in the series. Great story!!, I don\\'t believe I reviewed this Book 6 when I read it the first time. But let me say, that it was just as amazing the second time around. I couldn\\'t put it down! I plan to run out and buy Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows just so that I can continue in my Harry Potter reverie! Harry Potter is definitely worth a re-read every time., Cleverly made. It\\'s also possibly the saddest one. After this, it all goes kinda downhill. Possibly the scariest one too., Every time I read a HP book, I am amazed - plot, characters, place and writing - fantastic!!!!!, 4.5 stars \\n Mindig ugy emlekeztem erre a konyvre, hogy igen eros de ujraolvasasom soran rajottem, hogy bizony gyermeki kepzeletem akkoriban mashogyan latta a dolgokat. Nem kell felreerteni, meg mindig szeretem ezt a reszt, de egy picit vesztett regi fenyebol. \\n Hianyoltam nagyon a Weasley ikreket, szamomra ok az abszolut favoritok a csinyeikkel egyutt (bar ebben a kotetben is sokat mosolyogtam, ha nem kacagtam parszor). Azt viszont kiemelnem, hogy nagyon jo erzes mikor olyan reszhez erek amire emlekszem, mintha minden sokkal baratsagosabb es ismerosebb lenne! \\n Termeszetesen itt is voltak pillanatok, amik szivszoritoak; es a fokozas meg hatra van!, Annual re read of the series., Put three stars because only at the end the book started to have something action and for 80% of the book it was just dragging along with the usual. I think it was the slowest read from all potters for me., The ending of this one made me so freaking mad! *Ugggh*, I loved this book. I love it ecause we got so much background on Voldemort, which was very interested. This is also our first taste of horcruxes. The love story in this one is good. I really enjoyed seeing ron\\'s and hermione\\'s read-between-the-line love for each other., I absolutely loved this heartbreaking adventure of a book! It is amazing and timeless as well as ageless, I cannot believe how into it I am. It is absolutely captivating!!, This book is about harry potter,hermione granger, and ronald weasley, they are wizards and witches!!!!!!!!! \\n In the half-blood prince harry finds out that his least favoritte teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, profesor Snape the former potions teacher is the person he\\'s been looking to for help/advice in potions. Using Snape\\'s old potions book with notes and tips he does really well., Just one of many rereads and yet I still pick up on new bits and pieces I missed or glossed over before. \\n And book Ginny is the best., Half-Blood Prince is my favorite Harry Potter book. It is the tightest written of the series and sets up some really awesome mysteries and cliff-hangers to lead up to the final book. It takes great leaps in growing up from the previous installments, both for the characters and for the development of Rowling\\'s writing., Reread in 2011 \\n Reread in 2013 \\n Reread in October 2015 \\n 4.5 \\n I always said that this book was my least favorite out of the series and I\\'m going have to say it still is. I definitely like it more so this time around than last time. I\\'m not exactly sure why; maybe because I\\'ve been connecting to the characters more so. Anyway. SO SAD. THE FEELS. \\n P.S. Ginny is so kick ass. \\n P.S.S WHY AM I NOT LIKING HERMIONE ANYMORE?! :( WHEN HAS RON STOPPED BEING MY FAVORITE CHARACTER?! WAHH :(, I listened to the audio book by Stephen Fry. \\n While I feel that Order of the Phoenix was a better book for drama, Half-Blood Prince shines for its character studies. \\n It sets up a lot for the last book in the series. I hope it pays off., I re\"read\" this as an audiobook narrated by Jim Dale. He\\'s an amazing narrator! \\n Anyway, excuse me now I\\'m gonna need a few days to recover from that ending., finally.....the voldemort revealed....complete book is spell binding full of mysteries like that of identity of half blood prince, intentions of draco , and above all , the horcruks.....never imagined that the room of requirement could be so dengerous...., Those last chapters still hurt... all these years later and they still hurt... \\n **** \\n Once again, the dark side of this series is in full force here. But even with the terrifying stories of how Voldemort came to be and all the terrible things he did, there are the bits of teenage angst and relationship drama one would expect from sixteen year olds. \\n This is also the first time there is something set up for the following book. At the end of the others its just assumed that school will resume as normal, and whatever happens will happen. This time around they aren\\'t going back to school, there is a wedding to attend, Harry has a vague plan for defeating Voldemort, and they need to find R.A.B. (The setup is rather nice!) \\n At the end of the book, when Fleur announces that Bills scars will prove that he is brave and that she is beautiful enough for the both of them, and when Tonks begs Lupin to understand that she loves him regardless, and when Ginny says she never gave up on Harry and that she still won\\'t, it proves everything that Dumbledore has always said is true. Love overpowers Evil., Call me crazy, but I adore the name Narcissa., Obviously, brilliant. She kills me. \\n Six might be my favorite, upon rereading, but that might just have been my state of mind while reading them. \\n Of course, I love Dumbledore\\'s assertion of love\\'s power and McGonagall\\'s statement at the end about Tonks & Lupin. <3 \\n Devastated all over again by the great loss. \\n But all in all, lots of great normal school stuff. Just wonderful with Bill & Fleur\\'s wedding to look forward to., Obviously told that the books were better, but now I definitely know it. So much more detail and story in the books. One of my faves so far., For the HIZZY FO SHIZZLE this was my favorite book so far even though I cried like a big dumb girl at the end because HOLY STUFF HAPPENING BATMAN, stuff got REAL REAL for the reals. Also I finished this audiobook in record time unlike the others where I totally took my time. The Order of the Phoenix, I wanted to HURL across the world numerous times and had to stop listening because I was so angry. This book was everything I wanted it to be plus more and more. Cannot WAIT for the last/final book and then I will probably listen to them all again because my love for this series is an enigma wrapped in riddle stuffed deep a pita., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Best of the series IMO. I love all the hints from the prince. The trips into the pensive were my favorite part. They really build on Voldemort\\'s history, particularly the parts with the Gaunt\\'s. I especially loved Morfin and his exploits on the muggles..., One of the saddest endings in literary history. I won\\'t ruin it for anyone who has yet to read it, but it will shock and really devastate you., Oh, The feels..., 6 down... only one more to go! And then Darren and I can finally have our Harry Potter Movie Marathon., I have reviewed the series as a whole, here., very good \\n love it \\n awyyyyyyyyyyyy :), World Building: A++ \\n Mythology: A+ \\n Girl Power: A \\n Guy-Hero: A \\n Plot-Twists: A+ \\n Suspense: A+ \\n Villains: A+ \\n Feels: A \\n For you clean-readers: this book does NOT have mature content, though there are some scary bits., I did not enjoy how they ended this book., One of my favourites of all the times, This is the 4th time I\\'ve experienced this book, and it just keeps getting better each time. I listened to it just last week and am beginning Deathly Hallows for the 3rd time. What can I say about HP. The more you times you read/listen to them, the more you are affected by the smaller things. One line that can bring tears to my eyes at any point in my day is when Harry and Dumbledore are returning from getting the Horcrux, and Dumbledore is in really bad shape, Harry says (something along the lines of), \"Don\\'t worry Professor, I will help you\" and Dumbledore says \"I\\'m not worried Harry, for I am with you.\" That, coupled with the talk he gave him on how scared Voldemort should be of Harry because of how Harry is capable still of Love, even after all he\\'s been through.....I am in waterworks. It\\'s just amazing storytelling. I am so sad they are through, but happy to enjoy them yet again., I think this is probably one of my favourites out of the whole series, after the Prisoner of Azkaban. It\\'s hard to be objective about a book in a series that practically brought me up, and taught me more lessons than I could count., I\\'m desperately trying to remember what happened in this book, but nothing really jumps out at me. So about average for the series., 4 STARS \\n \"It is the middle of the summer, but there is an unseasonal mist pressing against the windowpanes. Harry Potter is waiting nervously in his bedroom at the Dursleys\\' house in Privet Drive for a visit from Professor Dumbledore himself. One of the last times he saw the Headmaster was in a fierce one-to-one duel with Lord Voldemort, and Harry can\\'t quite believe that Professor Dumbledore will actually appear at the Dursleys\\' of all places. Why is the Professor coming to visit him now? What is it that cannot wait until Harry returns to Hogwarts in a few weeks\\' time? Harry\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts has already got off to an unusual start, as the worlds of Muggle and magic start to intertwine...\" (From Amazon) \\n The novels are all coming together and the suspense has me hooked to see how it all ends., I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVED this book!, Dumbledore, I did remember how I felt the first time I finished reading this book: I was furious to Rowling since she had a heart to give no more role to DD. I felt as lost as Harry... :\\'(, My review is here., I feel like my heart and soul have been ripped from my body. So many tears, and \"No, no no no no no!\" this book will rip your heart out. I loved it, it\\'s very well written, the characters well done, the story well told. It\\'s Harry freaking Potter. \\n Just leave me to my tears now...as I prepare to get ready for the final book in the series. \\n *sobs* \\n And why can\\'t we have half stars? I\\'d put it at a 4.5 but, close enough! Few minor issues with the book but still thoroughly loved it!, Great listening to this again!, So wonderful and fun. A great trip for everyone., For the first time ever, I have loved Ginny., It was written just as well as the others, but I didn\\'t like it quite as much because, it being the 6th book out of 7, it started to reveal and solve the mystery/suspense rather than increase it...This, of course, is appropriate, but I just found it not quite as exciting - and also sad! (The series is drawing to a close!), love love love, This is probably my favorite Harry Potter book. Of all time. Out of the entire series. Like whoaaaa.....the fifth one was my favorite while I was reading it but the ending killed me so it\\'s this and the fifth that\\'s \"tied\" but this one is higher because the ending killed me less because I WAS SO ATTACHED TO THE CHARACTER AT THE END OF THE FIFTH BOOK WHY ROWLING WHY YES IT MADE THE BOOK GOOD BUT YOU STABBED ME IN THE HEART ANYWAYS \\n WHY I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!: \\n 1. the second chapter. you think you know you have that all figured out BUT BITCH NO or do you??? totally messed with your mind of a hell of a reveal in book 7.... \\n 2. harrrrrrryyyy oh how i love him!!!! he develops as a person- angry with his short temper but his develop through this book is so amazing and so real....also the development of quiddith and basically everyone\\'s love life- ron, ginny, lavender, harry.... Rowling really made 16 year olds super horny LOL \\n 3. the ending is crazy. it hard to believe it when you first read it. the ending wasn\\'t heartwrenching for me because i still wasn\\'t over the fifth book ending honestly \\n 4. I like how ron and hermonie develop so realistically \\n 5. I FREAKING LOVE LUNA AND GINNY AND NEVILLE. THEY WERE SET UP TO DEVELOP THIS WAY!!! that\\'s the amazing part; i love how increasingly important they become as characters \\n 6. snape. snape oh snape. still an angry jerk but yeah. There\\'s so much we don\\'t know about him and you probably think you\\'re never going to figure it out and you\\'ll never find out but you will....OR WILL YOU??? \\n The added element of romance probably got me loving this book the most. Out of all the books this one had the best developed and most progressive romance which helped the with all the amazing elements Rowling was already using in her writing., In his sixth year at Hogwarts, the battle against Voldemort intensifies. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron do a lot of snogging as they complete their classes and fight off The Dark Lord\\'s minions., Yoooo all the feels are back man. I forgot how addictive this series is. I can finally say that, Ron, Hermione and Harry are #SQUADGOALS, The books get better throughout the series/, The series starts to go downhill here. THE MONSTER IN HIS CHEST!!! *eyeroll*, I did not enjoy this one as much as some of the others. It was probably because of trying to analyze the book instead of just enjoy it. How did Rowling keep all this information straight in her head?! Hopefully I\\'ll do better on the next book and let the magic carry me away., #38 HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE by J K ROWLING: Durfee\\'s top 50 novels countdown. Why this one? Certainly the most exciting of the series. And the death of Dumbledore far more poignant here that the wholesale slaughter of the remaining characters in book 7. And for the record, I was rooting for Voldemort the whole time. Pesky do-gooder protagonists spoil the ending of every story. Damn them., Great book! One of the best in the series :), Best of the series!, Wow. I was gonna give this a 4 before the ending. This book was different because from the rest of the series because it wasn\\'t as action packed, but after reading the ending I totally understand why. The Harry and Dumbledore bonding was so important as well as Harry\\'s and Ron\\'s relationships with Ginny and Hermione :\\'). Just ugh I\\'m speechless when it comes to HP books, Read the Canadian version. It was pretty cool., I\\'m kinda in love with this book, it made me cry several times, especially at the end oml, I\\'m definitely gonna read it again in a while!! It\\'s now on my list of favorite books!, I MISS ALAN RICKMAN..., I\\'ve always thought this book should have had a better movie adaption and I still think that! I love all the lessons with dumbledore and the emotional side of Draco that we got. The ending was sad of course but I liked how it was bittersweet. I wish we saw more of Harry being upset with Sirius\\'s death like in 5 but oh well, i hear a rumor before i read this book that somebody gonna die. i cant wait for the book. i want to know all the story. i was excited but also sad coz it\\'s gonna be the last book and i would never meet harry again. \\n finally, i bought this book in my spare time of my boarding training. and i reject all the invitations, i just want to read this book and i wont quit until i\\'ve finished it. \\n as usual, i read the last page first and i was so relieved that MY HARRY DIDNT DIE,, then who\\'s gonna die? is it true dumbledore?? NO,,,,, \\n it was a mixed feeling. it was a bitter than sirius died. i just cant believe it. afterall, i\\'m satisfied with this book but honestly i want something dramatically. i want \"HIM\" die in vain. not just like that. i want more than that. \\n i hope i could meet harry in another book. could JK make a continous book??? i want to know how harry\\'s sons grew up, and i want to know about their life. i want to know how\\'s harry die,,, i want something more hehehehe ;), Rowling why you hurt me this way! I just ended up this book with tears in my eyes and a broken heart., This book redeemed the annoying series for me. I thought it was awesome, although creepy. Finally Harry wakes up and does something!, Book Ginny is my new crush!, This is my favorite HP book, because of how seamlessly Jo combined the worlds of magic, war, and teenagers. It is also the first book to ever make me cry., The climax of Prince is devastating, all the more so for its bewildering ambiguity (resolved in the final book). Rowling also explores the growing pains of Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\'s relationships with real understanding of how difficult navigating friendships can be at that age, and she brings the moral shortcomings of authority figures--even the beloved Dumbledore--into fine, acutely poignant relief., The first book to ever make me cry. An amazing story that I personally recommend to anyone, at any age., Relectura. No he sentido la misma sensacion que cuando lo lei la primera vez, porque.. ya se el final y se porque ese personaje que todos odian hizo lo que hizo (aunque, recuerdo que era de esas chicas que lo defendian y nadie lo entendia xD, Just as amazing the tenth time., There are few books that I have a hard time putting down, but this is set apart as one of the elite. In anticipation the release of book 7, I took the opportunity to reread this installment of the Harry Potter series. They are young adult books, but I love Rowling\\'s writing style and the entertainment value of the series, but I also love the humor, depth of literary allusions, and the creativity of the plots. Of all the books in the series, this is my favorite thus far. Harry Potter has been locked into pop culture, but I wont let that tarnish my love for the books., There were some things I truly loved about this book. I loved how this comes close to the first few in the series but nothing too crazy going on. It felt like some of the older books and I love that feeling. All the Harry and Dumbledore time spent together and the memories of Voldemort\\'s past are all very interesting. Then Ginny and Harry coming together feels great. I always compare the book Ginny and movie Ginny and get disappointed each time..., Book 6 is a departure from the other HP books. Flashbacks teach us all about the history of Voldemort and what made him what he is. In the journey, Harry learns that while love is the most powerful magic in the world, it can also cause the most pain., I think this was my favorite of the series so far, at least tied with the Goblet of Fire. I cannot believe how weepy I got at the end of the book, definitely one of the more emotional things that has happened in this series. I won\\'t say what I am referring to for fear of spoiling it for anyone who may not have read it yet, but for those of you who have, you know what I am referring to. It has been so exciting to follow these characters and watch them grow. I am so excited for the final book but I am also sad because it means that I am almost done with the series. I know that I was super late getting on the HP wagon, but consider me a huge fan! :), I can\\'t believe this one ends like that. I can\\'t believe this is a children\\'s book. I can\\'t believe it. \\n This series is too awesome. It\\'s incomparable., Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - reread, love even more., It seems like I always pick up something new on every re-read. This time I noticed on 3 distinct occasions wizards making drinks appear out of nothing. And I\\'m trying to reconcile this with Book 7 where Hermione says they can\\'t just make food out of nothing because it\\'s one of the great big rules of magic. Am I missing something or is that a bit of an inconsistency? Either way, I still love these books!, I am in complete and total shock. I\\'m going to be in mourning for a while. :\\'(, Sad, but necessary story to complete the series in the next book. Loved how everything ties into earlier books. So interesting. I LOVED debating about what would happen in book 7 before it came out. The horcruxes were So imaginative., By far my favorite book of the series! I\\'ve read it so many times and don\\'t get tired of it., This will forever be my favorite Harry Potter book. <3, Another work of art. dY~dY\\'--, Loved re-reading this book. The second time around I didn\\'t cry when Dumbledore died , but I did get really emotional when Mrs. Weasley was talking about Bill and how young men who are healthy don\\'t always stay that way. Serious heart string tugging was going on. I liked that Voldemort is a total sociopath and collects trophies, like in TV shows about serial killers. It made me imagine him having a map with lines going everywhere and pictures of Harry Potter all over his bedroom. I didn\\'t find Slughorn as annoying as I originally found him this second read through. Still obnoxious but also really smart and calculating. \\n Can\\'t wait to read the last book but I don\\'t want HP book club to end!, Sediiihhh...tokoh favoritku Dumbledore harus tiada....tokoh yang yang paling ditakuti Voldemort ini harus tiada dengan cara yang sangat biasa, I was wrong. The Half-Blooded Prince is even darker than its predecessor. \\n Everyone is finally growing up. Falling in love seems to be one of the characters purposes in this book. There\\'s a couple of love triangles in this one. Namely, Ron/Lavender/Hermione and Harry/Ginny/Dean. Jealousy is at strike for them and their love for each other is inevitable. Harry is in love with Ginny Weasley, Ron\\'s sister. Hermione loves Ron, even though he is with Lavender Brown, his snogging partner(Ha!). \\n Meanwhile, Dumbledore has a plan for Harry: Revisit Tom Riddle\\'s(Voldemort) memories. There they find Riddle\\'s darkest intentions, his childhood, and the reason why he became the man that he is now. \\n That causes a new discovery: Horcruxes, which are pieces of soul in inanimate objects to ensure the person\\'s immortality(that\\'s what I understood, anyway). Voldemort has seven Horcruxes and they have to be destroyed. \\n Also, Harry finds a book with the name tag: \"Half-blooded Prince\"(hence the title). The book helps Harry to pass Potions and develops an obsession with the book. \\n Talking about obsession, Draco Malfoy is up to something, and Harry wants to figure out what is it. \\n I\\'ll say it: He is Voldemort\\'s helper. \\n Someone seems to regret it. \\n This book has a lot of twists, unfortunately, it has been spoiled repeatedly. So much, that I don\\'t think it matters if I say it: \\n Snape kills Dumbledore. There. I said it. \\n End of review of the almost final book., I reread this book right before book 7 came out. I found I liked it better the second time through., Re- read, I\\'m not worried Harry, I\\'m with you., I read somewhere that the last books of the Potter series lagged in comparison to the rest... \\n That was a lie. \\n If anything, I\\'m enjoying this series more and more. \\n But WHY DID YOU KILL DUMBLEDORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I CRIED so HARD! No, no no no no... first Black now Dumbledore! Whose next Hagrid? J.K. Rowling - did you invent this series just to break your fans\\' hearts? Harry Potter without Dumbledore is like a night without the moon... you have the stars, but they\\'re just not enough. ( cries ) \\n So yes, I\\'m officially hooked. I\\'ve joined the bandwagon. Count me in., Ahhh so good! Rowling never fails to make me cry, laugh and so much more. I\\'M IN LOVE WITH THE GOLDEN TRIO. The ending made me so sad though. Absolutely incredible!, Fame is not the only thing that Harry Potter will have to worry about as he trains with Dumbledore. Lord Voldemort\\'s forces are on the move, seeking to dominate the Wizarding world. I enjoy this story because it tells a classic story of an average teenager trying to cope with the burden of fame while struggling with world that is rapidly changing around him. I would recommend this book not only to Harry Potter fans, but also anyone who relishes fantasy, fiction, and coming of age books. A must read that should be introduced to every audience that can relate to the life of an average teenager., Why Ohhh Why my heart is hurting so bad I can\\'t believe this the ending the ending was pure torture it broke my heart into a million pieces what an emotional roller coaster read was Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was for me but I really enjoyed and love reading it and I can\\'t wait and I am kindy scare to read the last book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows next but I am super excited and can not wait to read the last and final journey for Harry to finally put a stop to Lord Voldemort and his evil Death Eaters At Rest! Well Until Next Time!, Some books instantly remind me of winter, this is one of them; but it is much more than the fact that I started reading this one next to a wood burning stove, covered in blankets. This book is cold. There is a tinge of bitterness and melancholy since the beginning, really; you can feel it while reading, some parts even make you feel sad. What happened at the end of Order of the Phoenix brought with it a promise of global change and it\\'s almost palpable now. There is no safe place anymore, Harry can trust very few people and even some of those he trusted to be friends still refuse to believe what he says about Voldemort, even though there could not be clearer evidence of his return. Nonetheless, I absolutely enjoyed this book from start to finish; I love how Rowling changed the whole pattern of the books from \"summer time; Hogwarts; problems; adventures\" to a real quest to defeat Voldemort. \\n Differently from previous books, on this one nothing of particular impact happens to Harry before the new semester at Hogwarts begins. The only significant event that I can recall is Dumbledore using him as a human magnet to attract a new, supposedly, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. So we are introduced to Slughorn, which I liked from minute one. In my opinion, he is one of the most believable characters that Rowling ever created. Most of the wizards (not considering Harry, his friends and the majority of the Weasleys) display a certain stoic behavior; some of them, like professor McGonagall, for instance, don\\'t even express much emotion during the entire series. Slughorn, on the other hand, is a Russian roulette of conflicting emotions since his introduction. He feels proud of most of his acquaintances, ashamed of some, afraid of others. He feels attracted to the opportunity of being a teacher which would allow him to meet even more talented people, but afraid of what impact the exposure as a teacher would make in his life now that the world of wizards is being set upside down. \\n Well, after this events, Harry is sent to the Weasleys\\', where nothing really meaningful happens. Then we have the customary travel to Hogwarts, where some enmities are reinforced, we might say. I must say that the atmosphere at school is utterly different from any of the other books. Some students didn\\'t even return to school, so afraid they were, which I don\\'t quite remember happening before, even when the Chamber of Secrets had been reopened on book two. \\n As soon as the semester starts, Dumbledore starts inviting Harry to private conversations at his office, so we start to realize what this book is really about: send normal school affairs to the dumps, let\\'s investigate Voldemort\\'s past so we might come up with some way to defeat him. I found it great how Rowling added rebellious teenager behavior to back up Harry not caring much about school anymore, focusing on his new found mission. It added a much more believable sense to the character and to the whole story itself. Anyway, during the whole book we get to know, through collected memories of people who interacted with Voldemort during some points of his existence, a lot of unimaginable and priceless information which helps us understand what drove him to become what he is now: a monster. \\n Setting Harry\\'s mission apart for an instant, I would like to mention how fun some parts of this book were, due to the tinge of \"sex, drugs, and rock\\'n\\'roll\" that Rowling displayed. There are constant love conflicts, hormones are exploding everywhere; even Hermione, which I could never guess cared much about people, was found crying in the corners, feeling alone and betrayed. Again, giving young wizards a little bit of \"muggle\" adolescence hell was very well done in the sense that it makes the story much more believable. \\n As the story goes on, Dumbledore and Harry get closer and closer to uncovering Voldemort\\'s deepest secret, which leads them to go outside Hogwarts in search of evidence. Unfortunately, the results of their little adventure are disastrous. Getting advantage over Dumbledore\\'s momentary absence from Hogwarts, the dark forces find their way into the castle and things get really bad. Rowling is not afraid anymore, so the signs of her advanced \"George R. R. Martin syndrome\" are firmly displayed, which makes me take a star out of this book. The ending is bitter and sad, setting a clear path to what we can expect on the final book. \\n Interesting quotes that I didn\\'t include in the review: \\n It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. \\n Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right., Re-Read Number thirty-something - July 13th 2014., My second favorite of the Potter books, I\\'ve read this one about a dozen times. It\\'s always nice to curl up with a favorite book, even if the Malfoy plot one drives me nuts., Professor Dumbledore leads Harry on a mission of truth. A dangerous time awaits him as he learns more and more about his family past and the connection Valdemort. Wonderfully written., Qualcosa di unico... Il maghetto sta crescendo e il libro passa ad un livello successivo mantenendo quei pilastri che lo contraddistinguono. \\n Uno dei miei preferiti., Definitely one of the darkest of the books, this was truly a heartbreaker, I adored finding out more about the Malfoy\\'s and their involvement with Voldemort and Snape! oh Snape! <3, My favorite book of the series! I have read it about five times., This is my favorite of the HP series. \\n I love the Pensieve (great word by the way - the root words are a simple descriptor of its function) as a device for \"showing\" rather than merely \"telling\" Voldemort\\'s history. Indeed the story of his mother might be one of my favorites. \\n Along with the Pensieve, I love all the one-on-one talks Harry has with Dumbledore. I always look forward to Dumbledore\\'s speeches and talks with Harry in every book and I get a lot of them in this one. I guess, like Harry, I\\'m Dumbledore\\'s man through and through. \\n I love that Snape and Harry were able to develop a relationship through the potions handbook -it is like Harry finally got the potions teacher he really needed, and all of his defensiveness gave him the opportunity to feel empathy for Snape. \\n I think the lack of stressful school-stuff made this one more bearable and therefore enjoyable. You\\'d think I \\'d be a pro at academic stress but after my experience reading Order of the Phoenix, apparently I can\\'t handle even fictional school stress. \\n Horcruxes are just really cool. \\n Didn\\'t like so much: \\n Some of the horcrux magic still doesn\\'t fully make sense to me -I will always feel a twinge of annoyance about the clumsy descriptions of how Voldemort\\'s soul floats around and attached to bodies without the aid of a horcrux in the first book -but I appreciate that Rowling at least attempted to explain it in this one. \\n I could have done without all the snogging, but given their ages, it was at least appropriate I guess. \\n More Hermione please!, Finally! Finally, HP grew a set., This is book will always stand out to me!, Amazing that she was able to maintain this kind of consistency across so many books. Another amazing ride especially due to the Pensieve trips. This book is really the setup for the grand finale and boy does it deliver. Reading it the second time around also makes you appreciate how well thought out the books have been. Every comment made has some relation to the past or what is to come. I think the second reading was definitely better that the first. Onward!, awesommmmmenesssssss of awesommmmeneeeees \\n Old friend Dumbledore why have you left meeee????, My favorite book from the series, mostly because it makes a little bit clearer who is going to end up with Hermione, and I was betting on the right one, so I think I was happy I got it right the whole time., Per adesso, il mio libro preferito della saga. \\n Anche se sono rimasta tramortita dal colpo di scena finale, e dalla morte di uno dei personaggi piu\\' belli ed importanti. In un modo che tuttavia mi puzza tanto...perche\\' sarebbe troppo semplice un tradimento cosi\\' totale. \\n Comunque, bellissimo., So, on the night this book came out, Tyson was over at my house drinking. We got pretty silly, and googled spoilers for this book. The book had only been out for 2 hours. So, Tyson calls Gavin (whose girlfriend is a huge HP fan), and tells him how the book ends. \\n So, at this house party, Gavin gets on a table, cell phone in hand, and starts screaming \"Dingledorf is dead! Dingledorf is dead!\" \\n Tyson and I just about died laughing. \\n This book was good. Much better than OotP., the first Harry Potter series i read!!!!! i love the movies and i love the book even more!, este libro fue maravilloso,me encanto como la escritora manejo la accion y el misterio y me mantenia conectada a la historia ,aunque me entristecio mucho lo ocurrido en cierta parte de los capitulos finales,fue inesperado y doloroso,pero aun asi fue un libro maravilloso y se convirtio en uno de mis favoritos de esta saga., it was really good! since Dumbledore is dead, what will happen??, And so lies the book that set forth a thousand adults\\' tears. \\n So great is its prominence that when I emerged for dinner, very subdued, my family joined me in mourning after I told them I\\'d just finished The Half-Blood Prince. \\n God, Jo. Why don\\'t you don\\'t you snap a broomstick across your knee and stab me in the heart with it? I\\'m sure it\\'ll be much less painful., As always, an interesting character is introduced, and it took a while for me to figure out whose side (if any) Horace Slughorn was on. I enjoyed the memories of Voldemort\\'s past that Dumbledore shared with Harry: perhaps slower-paced than the frenetic images I see in the movie trailer (I haven\\'t seen the movie itself), but fascinating nonetheless. Harry\\'s irritating dismissal of others\\' wise counsel throughout the series is lessened, and this personality flaw is also counterbalanced by his kind treatment of the school weirdo Luna Lovegood., So many feelings!, HBP is, in my opinion, the strongest novel in this series - at least in terms of story. Insight into the history of a killer, the unrelenting knowledge that a sinister plot is brimming just below the surface, and the shocking tragedy of the last five chapters make it an absolutely unforgettable piece of the Potter Puzzle. I first read it when it was released, but I consistently come back to re-read it any time I\\'m craving a trip to the wizarding world., Definitely a Must Read within the Harry Potter Series. \\n Great set-up to the final book. \\n Beautifully written., Fabulous as are all the books :), The best Potter book. It\\'s often said that villains are more intriguing than heroes, and this proves especially true in this penultimate volume, as Dumbledore and Harry search the memories of various characters to uncover clues to Voldemort\\'s master plan. Rowling uses this plot device to deliver the backstory of Tom Riddle, and it\\'s ingeniously disturbing and exciting. The present day story concerns Harry\\'s discovery of an old, marked-up textbook that he uses to excel at Potions, and the two plots dovetail into a deliciously perfect setup for the final chapter in the story., As the series speeds to its conclusion the evil is near, the action is taunt, and nobody is safe. Dark, scary at times, and a real page turner. As I neared the end I was started to get sad because I knew there wass only one more to go., Re-read June 2014., Oh my gosh!!! I can\\'t get enough. Must. have. seventh. book. NOW! (Full review to come.), This book broke my heart!! Dumbledore died.. wtf, One of my favorites in the series. I very rarely read books more than once, but this series is definitely an exception! Can\\'t wait to read the last one again soon!, CAUTION: SPOILERS \\n I actually can\\'t believe I\\'m on the last book already. I was always intimidated by the size of this series (and the size of the books in it), but it has flown by! So fast in fact that I don\\'t want it to end. I am in awe at how much this series has gotten under my skin! I\\'ve tried to read other things in between, instead of just binge reading, but I\\'ve found that I have trouble getting into anything else because all I can think about is continuing the series. And I know I\\'m going to have a book hangover from this series! It\\'s definitely special, and it\\'s going to be hard to read something that compares after this! \\n I have to say I was kind of underwhelmed with the reveal of Snape being the Prince. I mean, it made sense after Hermione explained it, but there wasn\\'t really a big revelation there. It was just kind of like, Oh, I\\'m the Half Blood Prince...and then was barely mentioned again even though the book is named after him and the Prince\\'s book was a major part of the whole story. \\n Also DUMBLEDORE OMG. I had trouble believing it at first, which is ridiculous - I remember his death very clearly in the movie, so I *knew* he was dead but even still, it didn\\'t seem real! I still can\\'t get over it. I did eventually start crying when they were all talking about it, and again at his funeral. I CANNOT DEAL. *sobs* \\n FINALLY, Harry and Ginny get together! I didn\\'t realize how late in the series it happened. I kept waiting for it! Also, I kinda wanted to bash Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s heads together. They clearly have the hots for each other! \\n Something I absolutely love about this series is that there is never a love triangle between Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Harry and Hermione are never more than just best friends. It\\'s so rare to see platonic love in stories, and I wish there was more of it! Boys and girls CAN just be friends, people. I love that Harry and Hermione prove it. And it\\'s absolutely beautiful! They are as close as brother and sister and I love it so much! I think their friendship is one of my favorites in fiction. I want a platonic friendship as deep as they have. \\n Favorite quotes \\n \"And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\" \\n This review was originally posted on Novel Heartbeat. To see a breakdown of my assessment, please visit the full review here., Read it for a second time love it., I am re-reading the entire series. I forgot how great this book is (I think I tend to avoid it because it is sad)., I\\'m broken. \\n No words. \\n Just tears. \\n And more tears., This was my favorite in the series by far. Also, I am not ashamed to admit that I cried at the end..., J. K. Rowling never fails to amaze. This one of the best books in the Harry Potter series. The plot was amazing. The ending was surprising and left me shocked for a week. A great read and re-read. The characters were also really well developed. Continue reading this series because it is amazing and will leave you wanting more., Whether adult or child! What a great fun read! \\n 1st read: 2005 \\n 2nd read: 2007 \\n 3rd read: 2014, SO AMAZING. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! BUT DUMBLEDORE.... !!!!!! :(, I knew how it was going to end and yet I still cried. such emotion packed into one little book., I don\\'t know why I\\'m rating these all fours. I feel like it\\'s my bitter way of admitted they\\'re really good, but standing firm to my \"it was okay that I didn\\'t read them until now.\" \\n Dumbledore dying was sad (sorry if I ruined that for you), but I had seen the movie...so really how sad could it be reading it. \\n I liked. \\n I\\'m almost done., Read it whatever year it came out., Another amazing telling of part of the tale of Harry Potter. This book was one of the better of the seven so far. I look forward to the next one very much., Yes yes yes I\\'ve only just now finished this... GET OFF MY BACK lol I don\\'t know why it took me so long. I have mental problems. But OMG I think this is my new favorite Harry Potter book! I loved learning everything about Voldemort\\'s background and I just thought this one was so so good. I mean they are all amazing. Again, I don\\'t know my problem... Anyway I listened to the audiobook for this one because Jim Dale is a freaking amaaaazing narrator. It was so much fun listening to this. I love love loved it. These books are just so magical and I\\'m so glad I finally experienced this one. \\n Also... the movie now seems so shitty in comparison lol. They changed too much and I just... I mean I thought I really liked that movie, but now I just think about how much it failed. \\n *SPOILER ALERT* in case I\\'m not the only weirdo who hasn\\'t finished this series. \\n but my biggest problem was that in the movie, Dumbledor didn\\'t \"petrificus totalus\" Harry... in the movie he was just hanging out underneath them... and that\\'s so NOT Harry! Harry would never just stand there and not intervene. They should have had Dumbledor petrify him. That makes so much more sense! And he still could have gone after Snape that way because the second Dumbledor died the curse was broken! So.... I just don\\'t understand why they changed that in the movie?! It\\'s so out of character!!! Also I\\'m mad they changed Harry and Ginny\\'s first kiss and get together stuff. It was not as good in the movie at all. They just changed silly things that I don\\'t get. Although... I will admit that I loved the portion of the movie when Harry had taken the felix felices. That was so funny! Lol I enjoyed that part of the movie a lot. So I didn\\'t mind the changes they made there I guess. But still. The book was SO much better. Of course. Because it always is lol., Currently listening to the audiobook, All i can say is Snape (*sigth*)... I know I had a good reason to love you from the beginning., Thankfully, this book was much better than its predecessor and was probably the best in the series so far. It was nice to be at Hogwarts but not constantly covering the same ground as in previous books. The pace was steady and it moved along well. I\\'m looking forward to the next one., Every time I read this series, I discover more. This time around, I realized that Harry has seen someone die in front of him every year since the 4th up to the 7th. No wonder he has so many emotional issues., Nooooooooooooo Dumbledore!, We were not prepared for this book. \\n This book is the darkest so far of the series. Harry begins secret lessons with Dumbledore in order to find a way to defeat Voldemort once and for all. \\n Highlights include awkward teen romance, The Slug-Club, and a very suspicious Draco Malfoy. \\n Best moment has to be: \"There\\'s no need to call me \"sir\", Professor\". \\n Highly recommend., My goodness, this is a great book. The depth of character development is amazing. Although the book is substantially long, it doesn\\'t feel so; it reads quickly. By the end of this book I am always feeling as if I\\'ve been on a roller coaster ride and I\\'m always in tears. Rowling amazes me with her ability to choose the exact right word for every situation. Her writing is exemplary. \\n This last reading was probably around the tenth time I\\'ve read this and it gets better every time., Preparing myself for the long battle ahead. I solemnly swear that I will be up to no good for a good long while. Like four years. \\n \"Dumbledore will only leave from Hogwarts when there are none loyal to him!\" \\n \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\" \\n \"It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated. . . .\" \\n \"We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.\" \\n \"There are much more terrible things than physical injury.\", All the feelings...., Finally, after a drawback from the fifth book in the series, there are finally actions in this series. Harry, who are now a real wizard even though he\\'s still a student, will discover what will kill Lord Voldermort once and for all. With all the secrecy between Harry and Dumbledore throughout the school year, finally revealed itself the true history of Lord Voldermort and how to defeat him. However, in doing so, was very costly that someone very dear to Harry was taken from him. This book ranked the top for one of the most heartbreaking scene that left me crying. This book is beautifully written and would highly recommend this to everyone, including children. Very good storybook., My favorite book of the series (we\\'ll see if Deathly Hallows can top it). Enjoyed every second! I don\\'t know if I have cried so much reading a book. I have one more book but don\\'t know if I want to read it yet because I really like being in this world and don\\'t want it to end., Even with knowing the end, it still has the power to break my heart. Having just finished, I still have tears blurring my vision. Great stories move you even when you know where they are going., I enjoyed this book much more than Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix. I picked the the last installment from the library. I am really going to miss Harry and his friends when I finish the series. I never thought I would enjoy these books but I love the characters and the imagination the author used in writing these books. They do get more gruesome as the series goes on so I did have to tell my 7 year old daughter she couldn\\'t read them anymore. I didn\\'t want to have to explain or have her trying to visualize Harry being chased by dead bodies!, No actual plot \\n The story of the sixth book is very short and simple, consisting mostly of flashbacks rather than actual events taking place in the present. In fact, Harry is more like a passive observer to these events. This book could have easily not be called Harry Potter but rather \"Voltemort, the Early Years\" since it was mostly about the origin of the villain. A villain I don\\'t give a shit about since he got defeated by his own powers and didn\\'t learn from it. \\n Magic nonsense \\n The nonsense of the magic world continues as we see the wizards using their memories as footage instead of video recordings. We hardly remember things as they happened, so memories are an awful source of information. Unlike video recordings, we twist around the events to remember them as we want them to. Which by the way, is something that happens even in the book, as they are proven to be easily falsified. Our impression of the past has little to no relation with how events actually happened. This system of evidence is bullshit! \\n No defenses \\n Once again, the magic police failed to capture even one of the hundreds of bad guys that escaped and the only people they arrested were innocent wizards who had nothing to do with evil acts. They were so desperate that they had to seek help by children selling magic pranks. You know, stuff like sneeze dust, hearing ears, and invisibility hats. That\\'s right, the elite in the ministry of magic never heard of simple trinkets, children create for fun. Five thousand years of magic history and this was the first time they heard of an invisibility hat or enhanced hearing. Didn\\'t these people ever hear of D&D? The core books are full of ideas. \\n And once again the security at the school is paper thin. So what if they are now searching school bags and prevent teleportation? The kids could still smuggle in, anything they like through mail. Why do you go as far as searching bags but not the mail you stupid teachers? Those rascals were sneaking in guns and drugs under your very nose! Why were you even surprised when the school is invaded by evil wizards who teleported through a closet, in an area that does not allow teleportation? So much for magic making sense. \\n Circular logic \\n In this excuse of a story, Harry is given the task to extract memories from a wizard, concerning info about the Big Bad. Disregard how memories are not trustworthy and can easily be altered. Although he did manage to succeed in that, once again it wasn\\'t done with wits or strategy. No sir, he just cheated, like always. He drank a luck potion which lets him automatically succeed in anything. That\\'s right, you don\\'t need to try hard to succeed, you just need a convenient mcguffin which for some reason didn\\'t exist so far. \\n But wait, you might think, if Harry got the potion because he was very good at potion brewing, means that he did something right and got rewarded for his talent, instead of staying inactive as always. I should be praising him for doing that. Only thing, he didn\\'t succeed by trying hard. The one who gave him the potion was the same wizard he was sent to extract memories from. Essentially, the conflict resolved on its own, by using circular logic. Harry wasn\\'t even needed for fulfilling this mission. ANYONE could have done that as long as he had drunk the potion. There is no way of losing if you drink it. \\n Winners always cheat \\n He also didn\\'t get the potion by being good at potion brewing, which would excuse him deserving to drink it and extracting the information. He was cheating the whole time by using a notebook full of potion brewing secrets. And no, he is not excused for using those notes properly and thus deserving to get the potion. He deliberately kept the notes hidden from everybody, and pretended he was a genius at brewing potions. What an asshole! And thus, Rowling is once again advising little children to cheat all the time in school instead of trying hard. \\n Character de-evolution \\n But wait, who gave him the notebook? Maybe he got it as reward for something he did right, and thus he at least deserves to get the potion by cheating. Nope, he randomly found it without doing anything to deserve it. And as it turns out, it was a trap set by a traitor who was manipulating him throughout the whole book. You would think Harry would be far more careful after the 10th time a teacher of the dark arts is revealed to be a traitor, and an evil notebook that was brainwashing children in the second year. But no, he still falls for it like a complete newb. He has no free will in this whole story and is just moving from one plot device to another plot device because Rowling has no clue how to keep him consistent with past events. And this is what really gets me with fans of the books. They keep praising them for having characters that develop as years go by, when we clearly see here Harry didn\\'t change one bit. Where are these changes you are talking about? Are you referring to Dumbledore having a different actor in every movie? \\n Disgusting romance \\n You want more plot devises? Good because the luck potion is so overpowered that Harry abused it not only for fulfilling his mission, but also to get laid. And he did it in the most despicable way imaginable. He found a girl he liked and charmed her into falling in love with him. This was not achieved through personal charisma, it was the effect of the potion, meaning he brainwashed her. And what makes this situation even worse is that the girl already had a boyfriend. Harry abused the potion to make them have a fight and break up. Meaning, not only he seduced her, he also destroyed the love of two people. What kind of a message is this Rowling? Is this supposed to be romance? You are advising the children who are reading this shit to consider romance being the same as secretly purring Viagra in drinks, so they can get laid. \\n Deus ex potion \\n And I am not even done yet. The luck potion is so broken, that it makes all spells targeting you to boomerang back to the guy who casts them. Which is exactly what Harry and some other kids did at the end of the book so they can defeat super elite evil wizards. Screw decades of training hard in mastering magic; epic level wizards got owned by rookies because they drank the potion of plot armor. And of course only the good guys have access to this plot devise and not the bad guys. Because if they did, they would have killed all the powerful good wizards in the world by standing still and letting the spells they are targeting them, to bounce back at their face. Great use of strategy once more Rowling. \\n Winners don\\'t need to try anymore \\n Which brings us to another question. Why did the wizard give such a powerful potion to Harry just for being good at a school session? With this thing you can capture the gold sphere in Quidditch, get laid, or win the lottery. Hell, why think so small; you take over the world with this potion, and you hand it around to anyone who gets an A at a test. You are also rewarding a student who won, by letting him keep winning at everything thereafter without having to try anymore. What kind of logic is this and how is it fair for the rest of the students? \\n Uninteresting death \\n Another major secondary character dies at the end of this book and again I am left completely uninterested about it. They can always use the time machine to undo his death. Oh, that\\'s right, they destroyed the time machines so Voltemort can\\'t use them. God forbid if they had used them to prevent him from even becoming powerful in the first place, so none of that shit ever happened. Also, the reason the major character got killed was completely stupid. If he had a couple of \"win at everything\" potions with him, something he could have easily done since he is a freaking archwizard, this would never have happened. Do you see what happens when you abuse magic to the point nothing matters anymore? And why did he even take Harry with him? He was completely useless the whole time. \\n Demystified fame \\n And hold on a freaking second. Spells that bounce back to their caster? What does that reminds me of? Oh that\\'s right; the way Voltemort was originally defeated. Rowling, are you honestly telling me that there was such a thing all along and people made a legendary hero out of Harry as a baby for something anyone could have done by simply drinking this potion? So what was the point of Voltemort wasting four books in trying to undo the plot armor shield Harry had by his dead mommy when Harry can just drink the potion and get it back? And do you know what else that means? Harry\\'s fame makes no sense by making the super amazing spell only his parents knew of and nobody else could possibly comprehend or copy, to now be just a side effect of a potion everybody knows about and uses all the time. So what the hell does that mean, everybody who drinks the potion is a legendary hero? Holy shit Rowling, you just power creeped the hell out of plot armor, to the point it makes its super importance that you were constantly rubbing in our faces in the first 4 books completely worthless by now. Epic fail!, ALWAYS, FOREVER., Read in 2005 and listen as audio book in 2013. Stephen Fry is awesome, That was the saddest ending among the books so far. Even though I knew what was going to happen from having watched the movies, the book has ten-times the impact of that certain wizard\\'s death. It was devastating, really. \\n The Half-blood Prince has absolutely knocked off The Goblet of Fire from my top favorite Harry Potter book because it was certainly the most brilliant of them all. And that\\'s really something since every one of them were magnificent. \\n The romances. Gosh, Harry and Ginny were so adorable! I couldn\\'t keep the goofy grin off my face. The kiss after Gryffindor won the House Cup! Ron and Hermoine. Tonks and Lupin. Even Bill and Fleur. Fleur ceratinly won me over as she had Mrs. Weasley with that \"I\\'m good-looking enough for both of us\" bit. \\n But of course, the most important part of the book, Harry learning of Voldemort\\'s past. The Horcruxes. And how deep the bond Dumbledore and Harry had developed throughout the series. How Dumbledore saw Harry as an equal and how much he trusted Harry. The \"I\\'m not worried. I am with you.\" was quite moving. \\n Draco Malfoy. Hmm. I still want to believe there\\'s still hope for this boy. I still don\\'t like him but he\\'s as much as a victim here than anything else. Snape, on the other hand, I never liked him really. BUT I know he\\'s really not a villain. I think he\\'s working on Dumbledore\\'s side as much as Harry was... because I\\'ve seen the movie. But I dunno, The Half-Blood Prince was the last movie I\\'ve seen yet. That makes me excited on reading the last book (LAST?! Whaaa?) because I have no clue at all what was going to happen., My Favorite of the series. I honestly had no idea who the half-blood prince was until the end. I\\'m a sucker for Snape, I enjoyed having more focus on him., i listened to this as an audiobook for the first time. it was pretty great. probably my favourite in the series - it was funny and gritty in all the right spots. nostalgia plus!, This is my favorite of the series so far. I guess because some of the loose ends were being tied up and more things were making sense., Eu juro que eu so li porque era necessario para ler o ultimo. Ficou estacionado na minha prateleira por MESES., Norwegian audiobook. \\n So I did like this one more than the previous, but I still felt there were quite a few holes. \\n My first problem with this book is Dumbledore. Am I the only one who didn\\'t like him? I actually did like him in the movies, but in the books he is more annoying. I feel like he is just absent in the movies so it\\'s hard to dislike him, but in the books he is actively avoiding people and being secretive about it. I feel like all the books thus far have ended with him saying something to the effect of \"I have underestimated you Harry and it has lead you to grave dangers. I must not make that mistake again, from now on I must be upfront with you and trust that you are strong enough to deal with the truth.\" And then the next book he runs around being secretive again. This book is no exception. He even starts giving Harry lessons to make it seem like he is sharing information, though in the end it takes him almost the entire school year to tell him one thing. \\n Also, why is it so necessary for Harry to get this memory from the other professor if Dumbledore already know what Voldemort had done and has already started destroying the horcruxes? The memory actually doesn\\'t confirm anything at all. \\n Another thing, if Dumbledore knew what Malfoys was doing the whole year why didn\\'t he do something earlier? Why does he wait until the actual confrontation to say \"we can protect you and your family\". Wouldn\\'t it have been more likely to help him if the intervention was earlier, when he was less involved with the death eaters? Seems like he never really had any concern for Malfoy, which I don\\'t disagree with, but don\\'t come around and the last second and pretend you cared all along. \\n And then lastly, a point about his beginning scene. I think the beginning when Dumbledore goes to Harry\\'s house is supposed to be funny, but really it was just rude. It reminded me a lot of that article where they explain rape as if you are offering someone tea. You can\\'t force your tea on people. It is perfectly fine to not drink the tea, even if it is offered to you. It\\'s also fine to offer tea. But if people don\\'t want to drink it, it is not okay to pour it down their throats. \\n Anyway, onwards. \\n I thought this book was pretty good. I thought that this book was much like the previous where there was not so much action, but this one did work on the development of the characters more. I think that overall all the characters got a bit more depth to them. Ginny, possibly the most. Snape, for the worse. \\n The story had a few parts that were a little unclear. The cave being the largest one. It\\'s a bit unclear why and how Dumbledore is able to guess how exactly everything is supposed to be accomplished. He says that magic leaves traces, but I\\'m not sure how that leads him to the realization that drinking it is the only way. \\n Another part is the entire thing surrounding Snape. All of the questions Beatrix asks him in the beginning are super valid questions which he does not offer good answers to. Also, with all these ways of getting into people minds and watching their memories and truth serums, why can neither Voldemort nor Dumbledore utilize these with Snape? I can see the good side having some reservations about using such tactics, but I feel like Voldemort would not. And what about the unbreakable oath thing? Why would Voldemort not have every death eater doing that? Also, why was Dumbledore so secretive about why Snape switched sides. Why did everyone just have to trust Snape on his word? Voldemort\\'s wrath seems much more deadly and even his people openly questioned that decision. \\n Overall, an okay story to read but as the series continues the plot holes are stretched larger., After re-reading this sixth installment of the HP series, I was surprised to discover that it was my least favorite of the series thus far. When I thought about it, I guess I realized it was the book I remember the least of from way back when I read it for the first time. However, upon re-reading it, it was also the book I had the most to say about. Here\\'s a little compilation of some of my thoughts. \\n 1. The scenes on Voldemort\\'s past: I\\'m sure this is a favorite part for many readers of the series. It certainly was for me. I felt them more poignantly this time around, though I\\'m sure I did originally because the imagery from the scenes stayed with me for the most part. I find Voldemort\\'s mother to be absolutely fascinating. I couldn\\'t help but wonder how much of Rowling\\'s self came through in writing her character. That obvious depression and feeling of weakness despite harrowing and nearly impossible realities, like poverty and familial abuse, both physical and emotional. It has a truly disintegrating effect on people and unfortunately it can get the better of us...does that make us weak? Yes, I suppose. But does it make us pitiless? ...I think Rowling wanted us to think about that when she wrote Voldemort\\'s mother. 2. Madame Pince: I was reading this \"typical\" librarian character and suddenly found myself disappointed. I suppose I just felt that Rowling had another solid opportunity to make yet another amazing female character, but she sort of fell short. Of course, it\\'s totally possible she had a whole richly developed back story on the character and just never got to tell it because it didn\\'t fit anywhere. I would expect no less of Rowling. Perhaps I\\'ll just have to do a little perusal of the internet and see what I can find. 3. How friggin\\' awesome Ginny is: I don\\'t think my 14 year old self had nearly as much appreciation for Ginny\\'s character development, especially in this book, until now. She really becomes a feisty force to be reckoned with. She stands up for herself. She loves who she loves. Openly. Shamelessly. In fact, the character she reminds me of most is Harry\\'s mother. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY I THINK IT\\'S PERFECT THAT SHE AND HARRY END UP TOGETHER...but more on that later. (Sorta spoiler) 4. I love when Harry inadvertently compliments Snape\\'s *singing abilities: That is all., Slughorn is a joy. I still think Harry and Ginny\\'s relationship seems a bit forced. The quiet moments with Dumbledore are what make this one. I find it fascinating learning about Voldemort\\'s past. I also like seeing the conflicted nature of the Malfoys., I have been complaining alot about this book. The main problem for me is all the dragging on about Voldemort\\'s life in the memories. Of course, they are interesting and all that, but since I had seen the film it just never ended, and also the book was waaay different from the movie! That too just made me want to finish even faster. \\n The 6th HP film had always been my least fav. the only parts I do like is the ones with Dumbledore and the horcruxes. I guess the magic died in the book for me because I had seen the movie before reading the book...since there were alot of surprises, I already knew them before happening, bummer. \\n Oh well, JK is still and will always be a wonderful author and I loooove Harry Potter!!!, This is a strange roller coaster of a read. It alternates from extremely well written, to painfully bad. Pretty much any scene with Snape and Draco is perfect. The trio just gets dumb, Ginny who was awesome in OotP becomes a $%*^& in this one, but Harry likes her cause she\\'s pretty (can anyone say Oedipus complex?). I\\'m on the fence about the scenes with Tom Riddle...they take Harry Potter into a far more adult place, you can\\'t pretend these are children\\'s books anymore. I appreciate the sophistication they add, but it\\'s not fun and really never useful enough to Harry as they should be. \\n I think this book was rushed due to film demands. Rowling attempted to get the romance \"out of the way\" and with that mindset would have done better to leave it out entirely. This series deals so strongly with love, but there\\'s no love in these romances. Character feelings seem to be expressed mainly through jealousy and lust. Harry wants Ginny, enjoys her company, but you never get the feeling that he loves her...which may be realistic, but doesn\\'t fit the tone of the story. Ron and Hermione are a train wreck...they are TERRIBLE for each other, which this book demonstrates well and then awkwardly tries to force them together., I still remember the day my bff spoiled the ending of this book for me in class. He wasn\\'t my bff for about a month., relistened Sept 2016. so good. so sad, Six stars. Jim Dale\\'s performance takes Rowling\\'s masterpiece to another level. Listened this time. Finished reading in March 2016., reread September 2017, This book is so awesome! heh heh. Can\\'t wait for Deathly Hallows now..., this is BY FAR my favorite of the series....soooo dark!, Reread through the audiobook May 2016, This is less of a review nd more of a biased appreciation for this book. I think I am one of the few readers whose favorite Harry Potter book is the Half Blood Prince, probably because I spent the longest time reading it compared to the other books consequently allowing me to think more about the story while reading it. There was also more Dumbledore in the story and I do like Dumbledore and having finally answer all of the questions Harry and I had was a great pay off for more than happily sticking around for six books within this series.I also liked that Harry wasn\\'t always attached to the hip of Ron and Hermoine and was finally went out on his own side adventures with the Head master. I am also more drawn to the gloomier side of everything and the six series was absolutely bleak. Nevertheless all of this might change once I read The Deathly Hallows., No matter how many time I read this book, its as good as the first time, ALWAYS as good :), I.. I \\n WHAT \\n HOW \\n WHY \\n UGHHHHHHHHHH, No matter how many times I read this year in particular, it always makes me cry. It is SO suspenseful that it keeps me on the edge of my seat., OK--I must admit that this is my favorite--probably because this is where Harry FINALLY kisses Ginny! I think I cried through the last half of the book though--where Dumbledore tells Harry \"I\\'m safe with you Harry\". I know I\\'m WAY to attached to fictional characters., es cignic` miqvars. maxsovs, roc`a vkit`xulobdi, ert`i suli mk`onda gamego, vin iqo saidumloebit` moc`uli, nichieri, uc`nauri sheloc`vebis gamomgonebeli naxevarprinc`i. drako malp`ois misia da amast`an dakavshirebit` arsebuli daz\\'abulobac` p`riad sainteresoa., Emiri: 2006, 2008, This was my first time re-reading the book since it first came out and after the trouble I had with OOTP I was kind of wary about it but I actually finished in about the same amount of time, maybe even faster this time, and loved it the same. I just finished crying my eyes out over Dumbledore\\'s \"death\" -Call me Looney Luna because I say that it didn\\'t happen, he had a body double, and is alive still chillin\\' somewhere fun with a butterbeer., favorite harry potter book of all time. this one just truly trumps them all. i loved seeing the glimpses of who voldemort was and why he turned out the way he did., Reread in February 2016 \\n This one is so amazing just like the others it just breaks my heart though. Dumbledore is such a good character and then no more. There are so many things I didn\\'t remember from this book. Like how many times Harry and Dumbledore go into the pensive. I wish the movie portrayed all of those moments instead of just a few. I really like how much of a backstory we get into Voldemort through those scenes and we see the Horcruxes before the seventh instead of just the ring and the diary and the fake locket. Also there is more Ginny and Harry! I ship them together. In 5 and 6 Ginny really grows as a character and I really come to like her and Harry together. \\n I\\'m a fan of the movie because I think it does it well. Yes there are some big add ons and a few changes but it does it well. Now onto the 7th where I\\'ll be a hot mess during the process of reading and then watching., I finally read it! The latest installment in the series by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter & the Half-Blood Prince is an asset to the series. I found the book to be refreshing in that Harry continues to grow up (and mature) and while sometimes grumpy and melodramatic, has moved beyond being the sullen teen we saw in Order of the Phoenix. \\n As a reader of the series, I was not disappointed. \\n Highly recommended for Potter fans. For those unfamiliar with the series, it\\'s best to start at the beginning with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone., Shew loved it. So much better than the last book. I really like these books. I recommend them to all who like magic and suspense, laughter. No I do not look at it as evil like some portrayed it to be when they first came out. read the books or watch the movies., Finally Harry gets over the angst of his 5th year, and the annoyance fades from our relationship. I adore this book, the plot thickens, the characters develop, and Rowling writes beautifully as ever., Absolutely love this series. I am re-reading now that they are available on Kindle. Excellent books., Read these with the kids. Fantastic story., Still a great book, even the third or fourth time through., Another excellent installment in the series. Although I supposedly read this one when it first came out, I remember next to nothing of what happened. It was like reading it fresh, which was pretty great as a young adult. Although it doesn\\'t beat out some of my other HP faves, still a treat for sure. I like that we see Harry growing up a bit, maturing, trying to navigate all the knowledge and experiences he\\'s had that are so utterly unique to him. This is a pretty deep series for the young kids we were. Rowling continues to impress me with her rich yet accessible writing., Wow, I actually think I like Order Of The Phoenix more. This book is still really good, I love the story... even though many would argue that all the dating stuff and school politics is superficial, I actually really like that J. K. Rowling decided to add this to all the doom and gloom and Voldemort that usually happens. I\\'ve always enjoyed all the Ron and Hermione crap that happens, and this time was no different. \\n I have stronger feelings for this book than ever. This might in fact be my favorite... I don\\'t plan on rereading it for quite some time so we\\'ll see if I feel the same some years from now., 2017: \\n This remains my favorite for so many reasons. For one, it\\'s very much a calm-before-the-storm sort of book. There is so much rich backstory given that add layers to our villain. And Dumbledore, my God, I enjoy seeing so much of him here. He is deeply wise and emotionally intelligent, a kind mentor and merciful enemy. \\n I love how apparent it is that the secondary and even very minor characters have rich, complex lives outside of what is going on with Harry. Remus and Tonks give me the feels every time. And Ginny is clearly a brash, passionate force who never gets quite enough page time for my liking. I also found on this read through, a special appreciation of Molly Weasley, Super Mom., This is my favorite book in the series. It contains mystery, tragedy and sacrifice...it pulled on my emotions much more than any other book in the series (which I still love anyway)., I\\'m so sad, I\\'m still crying. That\\'s all I can say. I knew what was going to happen and I kept procrastinating reading this book because I knew I was going to cry. And...I was right. It\\'s still awesome and beautiful, but so so sad., Just plain heartbroken., SPOILER WARNING (seriously, you should have read these books by now, but just in case, don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.) \\n Aaargh this book. I want to love it so much, such a step up from OOTP but man that friggin ending. I hate it and I love it, but the bad vibes kind of overrule. I loved Dumbledore\\'s funeral, a very nice farewell to such a great character but I hate how he died. But most of all I hate that stupid \"noble\" break up Harry does with Ginny. Seriously? We\\'ve been waiting for those two to get together since forever, you give us a measly couple of chapters near the end of the book with hardly anything of it happening on page and then you just end it. And for what? This stupid shit about \"I have to let you go to protect you\". Bull-shit! Are you seriously telling me that someone like Lord Voldemort won\\'t be able to figure out how much Ginny means to him because he breaks it off with her for no reason whatsoever at the funeral? Oh and Ron and Hermione can come along on his grand adventure but who cares what happens to them, right? It is just poor writing which sticks out like a sore thumb in a series that is otherwise for the most part so well written and I can\\'t deal with this right now because I\\'m grieving for Dumbledore, damn it! I\\'ve become more lenient over the years and upped it from three stars to four, but you cannot expect to do stuff like that and get full marks. Not going to happen. Rowling did a lot of things right with this series, the romance however, isn\\'t one of them., How many books are in this series? I know people who are Harry Potter fanatics, I just don\\'t see it. This books was ok, but I am ready to get to the end of the series., A boy who lived dan pertandingan magic antar sekolah., Amazing. Amazing! Amazing!!!!!! There is no series that can outdo this one. I give my props to J.K. Rowling. This book kept me on my toes from page one. I couldn\\'t put it down when I got a chance to read it. Her writing is just unexplainably outstanding!, 2014 \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005) by J. K. Rowling 5a~...a(tm)Y= \\n (Harry Potter: Book 6 series) \\n Another reread of this great fantasy story. Really love this book the most. Funny comedy, action and adventure and teen drama stuff all wrapped up. \\n Harry Potter\\'s 6th year at Hogwarts. Voldermort has been forced to show the Ministry that he is indeed alive. So now everyone believes that Harry is \"The Chosen One\", but only Harry (and Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione) knows what for. And then there\\'s other stuff. Like Dumbledore giving Harry extra lessons, which are all about what Dumbledore knows about who Voldermort is and what he\\'s done. Harry\\'s also the Gryffindor quidditch captain, so a little more responsibility for him there. And what the movie doesn\\'t show is that Ron and Hermione are Prefects for the second time. And then their\\'s Harry\\'s emotions. Teen angst, obsession with what Draco Malfoy is doing and a struggle to keep his love for Ginny in check (\"She\\'s Ron\\'s sister!\"). Movie doesn\\'t show that the two got together and I wished they had because it was so cute, and also silly. \\n Oh and then there is the Half-Blood Prince\\'s Advanced Potions book that Harry found. Harry loves the book because he thinks he\\'s learned a lot more about potions from the Prince than he had from Professor Snape. (spoiler) And that\\'s ironic because the Half-Blood Prince turned out to be Snape. \\n SPOILER \\n But the ending. Tear jerker every time I\\'ve reread this. And rereading this with knowing who Snape really is loyal to... well this book and Harry\\'s opinion of Snape had me disliking the guy all over again. But I noticed something, Dumbledore actually tried to hint a few times who Snape is. It was just before Harry and Dumbledore went to the caves, when Harry was angry at Snape and at Dumbledore for trusting him. So Dumbledore actually let slip a few times why Snape had chosen to switch sides, even though he promised not to tell Harry the truth. \\n END SPOILER \\n I think there was a lot more adventure and action in this book than the others. Harry was always doing something, be it flying around on the quidditch field or going into the Pensieve with Dumbledore to observe people\\'s memories of Voldermort. And the ending was a gripping page turner, from the cave to the Astronomy Tower. And comparing this book to the movie, well I noticed a lot of differences. Like... \\n well another slight SPOILER: \\n Harry hid the Half-Blood Prince\\'s Potions book in a cupboard and places a bust statue and added the Ravenclaw Diadem to it, so that he\\'d know where the book was if he wanted it back. But I thought it was interesting that Harry didn\\'t even sense that the diadem was a horcrux. I wanted to throttle Harry for that mistake. \\n END SPOILER \\n I love this book and it was fun rereading this for the uptenth time (lost count really). And I will no doubt reread it again in the future. And every time, I seem to find something new that I didn\\'t notice before or forgot about., Full review: http://thelittlepresent.blogspot.com/... \\n Harus saya akui, kalau saya memang tergila-gila dengan cerita Harry Potter ini. Walaupun, jujur, saya baru sekali ini baca buku ini. Tapi saya suka sekali dengan cara tante JK menuturkan ceritanya. Rasanya saya juga terbawa dengan sikap keras kepala Harry, ke-arifan dan jalan pikiran Dumbledor yang berliku-liku, Hermione yang sangat menyanyangi Harry, dan Ron yang tidak percaya diri. \\n Membaca buku ini, rasanya seperti membaca buku serial detektif. Lihat saja pengaturan guru yang baru. Sejak awal Harry sudah men-declare-kan dirinya pada Prof McGonagall, bahwa dia ingin menjadi seorang Auror. Yang mana salah satu syaratnya adalah NEWST ramuan. \\n Nah, semua pada tau kan siapa guru ramuan tersayang Harry? Yup! \\n Prof Snape, mewajibkan nilai Outstanding untuk OWL, bagi setiap murid yang ingin mengambil NEWST ramuan. Sayangnya Harry Potter kita tidak menyukai gurunya dan hasilnya nilainya tidak sampai O. (Pelajaran buat mahasiswa/murid: cintailah gurumu terlebih dulu dan nilai bagus akan mencintaimu!) \\n Nah, karena kesempatan Harry jadi Auror nyaris tertutup, (ini hanya tebakan saya.) sepertinya kepala sekolah menggantikan guru ramuan dengan guru baru, Horace Slughorn. Alhasil, Harry tetap dapat mengambil NEWST ramuan dan dia mendapatkan buku ramuan pinjaman dari Slughorn. Dari sinilah petualangan Harry dan The Half Blood Prince dimulai., Love it!, Harry and Ginny\\'s relationship, Favourite book of the series!, Why is this in the \"Chick-lit\" list????????, , Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6) by J.K. Rowling (2006), Audible. Jim Dale is really terrific. This is only the third time I\\'ve read this book and it has been a long time. Really great., I reread this book for the first time since book 7 came out and totally enjoyed all the refereces to things that totally make sense now. Can\\'t wait to reread them all!, Perfect, 6 was slow and meandering at times, but the end packs a wicked punch. I can\\'t believe Dumbledore is gone or how affected I am by it. I can now see the myriad of reasons people need a break before reading 7., Excellent book! \\n A nice change from the set-piece of books 1-5., So where do I start? This book gets 5 stars. There are many things that make me wish I hadn\\'t so I\\'ll go through those first. \\n I really didn\\'t feel like much happened. Harry is learning some more cool pieces of Voldemort\\'s history, which is nice, but I maintain could have been peppered a little more throughout the whole series. The whole situation with The Half-Blood Prince and his textbook is rather minor, giving Harry an edge in his Potions class with Slughorn, and overall seems rather insignificant at this point (but who knows I have one more book to read). And once the identity of the Half-Blood Prince is revealed, it feels very anticlimactic as it is in the midst of the much more intense climax of the whole book. The majority of HBP felt rather slow. \\n Also, in my last review, I commended Rowling on her insightful development of her teenage cast. And while the relationship element of teenage life is continued in this book (ps-Ginny may be the gutsiest character in the book), many of the other characters that I enjoyed from OotP like Luna and Neville took a backseat to all the dating craziness of the central 3 (plus Ginny). Don\\'t get me wrong: Rowling\\'s descriptions of adolescent emotions and interactions between Hermione and Ron, or Ron and Lavender, or Harry and Ginny, etc. are pitch perfect. But my main man Neville is very much absent from the whole book. \\n So why then does it get 5 stars? (SPOILERS!!!!) \\n Simply put: SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE!!! \\n This isn\\'t really big news to anyone and I knew this long before I ever entertained the idea of reading TSS. However, there is so much more to it than that! The last 4 chapters are the most intense of the whole series thus far! We have watched Dumbledore practically die once already in the cave, which puts the reader on edge as it is! Then between the return to Hogwarts, Draco Malfoy\\'s last conversation with the Headmaster, and Snape\\'s seemingly villainous betrayal!? The total chaos of Harry pursuing them to the front gates of Hogwarts may be one of the two best portions Rowling has written in the entire series. And finally, once we feel the dust has settled, everyone reunites in the Hospital wing...Bill is maimed and may or may not be a werewolf, everyone is processing the very recent death of the Headmaster...and Fleur, whom has seemed endlessly shallow since she first appeared in GoF, says she will still marry a scarred wolfman Bill Weasely?! Its so touching! Such a glimmer of light in the wake of tragedy! And this is all topped off with Harry\\'s resolve at Dumbledore\\'s funeral...In my opinion, this is the first time we see Harry step up and put on his man pants. I finally believe that, care about, and want to see Harry stomp out He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in the final volume! Took 6 books and the death of a beloved mentor, but Harry Potter has at last manned up. These last 4 chapters send what I was anticipating to be the mediocrity of 3 stars sky rocketing up to 5! Simply fantastic., see book 1, This is still my favorite HP book of all. The introduction of horcruxes, Horace Slughorn, and Ron as Quidditch Keeper are new and interesting developments set against a familiar backdrop. I loved learning more about Voldemort\\'s life as Tom Riddle, and the interactions between Harry and Dumbledore. Needless to say, I cried at the end of the book to the extent I\\'ve never cried for a book. It was like a friend had died., Ironic on the night Hillary Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump I read of Dumbledore\\'s death. What a sad night!, 4.5 \\n Harry\\'s strength (and the combined strength of the Trio and Dumbledore\\'s Army) is love. It is one of the many large concepts swimming around in Half-Blood Prince. Loyalty, obligation, and choice are also star players here as well as grief and betrayal, but we\\'ll get there. The book opens with the concept that magic doesn\\'t make a more evolved society. It doesn\\'t prevent the world\\'s problems, and it in fact introduces a whole new set of them. We are gently instructed of this as the Minister of Magic meets with the Prime Minister and Snape meets with Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. \\n Half-Blood Prince is the culmination of the HP books before it, even more so than The Deathly Hallows. It\\'s a different kind of adventure: one of the intellects. The series\\' strength lies in its emotional payoffs. Harry embraces being the chosen one and begins planning for his seemingly inevitable future. The cornerstone of this book is Dumbledore fulfilling his word to Harry from Order of the Phoenix - he will teach him what he can to prepare him to fulfill his role in the war with Voldemort. Dumbledore trains Harry, in a sort of apprenticeship, and prepares him to find the Horcruxes by laying out Voldemort\\'s obsession with his own history and that of the founders of Hogwarts, his first true home (another in a long line of similarities between Harry and Voldemort). \\n full review continues: https://faintingviolet.wordpress.com/..., Possibly the best book of the series. The fight scene in the castle was epic. To J.K\\'s credit I think she made this book far too awesome for any book to follow up and perhaps that\\'s why some didn\\'t find book 7 as enjoyable. There was so much going on in here that everytime you read it it\\'s like a new book. Super awesome!!!!!, Not better than 5..... but still so good, LOVE THESE BOOKS :), Gahhhh. I spread out reading this over what feels like a year (probably not) because I used it as a palate cleanser in between books or if a particular book becomes tiring etc. etc. so now that I\\'ve finally finished it, the latter part of it is the freshest in my mind. I have my issues with Dumbledore mostly as I feel like Harry wasn\\'t protected enough like, ever, and it\\'s not that I have any suggestions, but most of my annoyance lies with Dumbledore being the most powerful wizard of all time and Harry A Child. Also, while reading this as an adult again, there is this almost constant gnawing sensation that Harry is basically being groomed to die for a greater good and while I know that nothing is that black and white and that Dumbledore cares for him deeply, I still feel some reactionary dislike towards him now. That all is eased quite a bit through this book, especially at the end - \"I am not worried, Harry. I am with you.\" I MEAN SOB. The Tonks/My Softspot of the Series ie Lupin arch is mindnumbingly difficult (he literally says Tonks doesn\\'t deserve someone like him, but someone WHOLE) and thankfully only a marginal heartbreak. \\n Again, knowing thingsss makes it much harder to go through the series as I am always pre-mourning people and I also beg every Snape apologist to read this book again because he is a horrible, horrible person and there are no fucking excuses. I will say again that being played by Alan Rickman in the films is his only redeeming quality. \\n There are so many darkly funny bits, like Harry being surprised to receive mail because \\'his only correspondent was now dead,\\' the whole thing with Malfoy is hilarious until it turns bloody and Death Eater-y because of how psychotic and obsessive our Harold is, Dumbledore savagely joking about manners literal minutes before his death and the harriest description of Harry to ever harry - \\'Harry sat there feeling mutinous.\\' \\n I can\\'t believe the only book I have left now will not take place at Hogwarts., Book Review \\n 4 out of 5 stars to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the 6th book in the Young Adult Fantasy series written in 2005 by J.K. Rowling. Although I could go on and on about this book, there are so many other reviews and reviewers who are likely to have a better one simply because they wrote it write after reading the book or watching the movie. I read it close to ten years ago, saw the movie at least 5 years ago, and though I would love to re-read them... my TBR pile is way too high. That said... it\\'s a fantastic series full of wild imagination, great beauty and intricate sentiment. In this book, Harry must connect with the past and his dark side, trying to figure out who this half-blood prince is... and when he finds out, everything is different. The book is about relationships... discovering things about yourself and others that you didn\\'t know. And when someone Harry absolutely adores is murdered right in front of him, and it\\'s connected with the half-blood prince, it sends Harry on a downward spiral, out of control, but necessary for him to find the inner strength to fight Lord Voldemort. I can\\'t even begin to write a review for this book... let\\'s just go get some coffee or a drink and talk about it. It requires us having an animated conversation... right? \\n About Me \\n For those new to me or my reviews... here\\'s the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

Thanks for stopping by., I just loved it. That\\'s all I can say. It\\'s easy to understand and the characters... just wow., One of my favorites in the series. I consider the entire HP series a must-read for everyone., Loved all the HP books but from here on they go downhill. Too long and so boring I never remember a thing after I\\'ve read it because almost nothing happens., I\\'ve read this book like five times but: still sobbing., Fast-paced and well-told. The mixture of character discovery, teen angst, and plot surprises are entertaining and engaging. \\n Five stars., I think this book was possibly my favorite of the entire series. I loved how much Harry has grown and the textbook plot was my favorite in that it was unexpected. Snape killing Dumbledore was fascinating (though I knew his reasons beforehand) and I really enjoyed Draco in this book. Great work, Rowling!, Loved it. Love each of these books more than the last one I read. Each gets better and better, And more things have have had to be left out because of the books length. I wish they could have done two movies for this book. \\n Wonderful Plot. I just don\\'t know how J.K. Rowling thought all this up. She is so creative. I could not have thought up half of the twists and turns she did. \\n The characters are the same as in the other books, with the addition of Rufus Scrimgeour, the new Minister of Magic. \\n I only found one error. A spelling mistake on page 38 that should have been found... line six says fug instead of fog. I had never heard of fug... but... typing the word in the LibreOffice Writer just now, it did not come up as a misspelled word. So I went and looked it up. It means the stale air of a crowded room. Interesting. You learn something new every day. So, I guess I was wrong... there are no spelling errors that I could find. Wonderful in such a long book. The editors and writer did a great job. \\n Because I have seen the movies so often the most interesting parts of the book, to me, are the parts that are different from the movies. The things they changed or had to leave out because the books are so long. There were only two really large plot differences, most of the modifications are small and insignificant, they did a really good job turning the books into movies. But there are many riveting and exhilarating things that have been changed. \\n Spoiler Alert: Below you will find many things that were left out of the movie. If you do not want to ruin the fun, if you have not read the books, then stop reading right now. If you have read the books and seen the movies and want to read about the things that were left out of the movie that I found interesting then read on. \\n I found it very interesting that Ex Minster of Magic Cornelius Fudge comes to talk to the Prime Minister of England. In the Prime Minister\\'s office is a portrait. It is a portrait like the ones hanging at Hogwarts. This portrait was used to announce to the Prime Minister that the Minister of Magic was coming for a \"conference\". Fudge come to update the Prime Minister on the state of things: He-Who-Must-Be-Named alive, Serious Black innocent but not dead, at War with He-Who-Must-Be-Named and the men that broke out of Azkaban prison, the bridge collapse, Death Eaters and Dementors on He-Who-Must-Be-Named\\'s side, other deaths and people missing, and Fudge sacked. It was also interesting to find that the Prime Minister\\'s secretary is an Auror, Kingsley Shacklebolt, who is there to provide the Prime Minister protection, though until this point he did not know it. (pg. 1-18 all of ch. 1) \\n There was no mention of Harry having private lessons with Dumbledore in the movie. Harry did go up to Dumbledore\\'s office to talk about the Horcruxes but in the movie they never called them lessons. It turns out these talks were the lessons they had in the book. (pg. 78) \\n On the train Harry was trying to spy on Malfoy. Malfoy figured out that Harry was under his cloak on the luggage rack and when everyone left the train at Hogwarts Malfoy froze Harry with the \"Petrificus Totalus\" spell and then Malfoy stomps on Harry\\'s nose. In the movie Luna finds Harry on the train, in the book it is Tonks that finds Harry. Many additional safety measures have been taken with Harry and with the school in general including extra adult wizards for protection. Tonks noticed that Harry had not gotten off the train and got on board to locate him. (pg. 152) \\n One of the main plot points of the movie and book is Harry finding the Half-Blood Prince\\'s potions book and using it. In the movie Harry and Ron fight for the newer looking book in a closet and Harry looses getting the Half-Blood Prince\\'s book which is more beat up but more useful. In the book Slughorn pulls two battered books out of the cupboard and giving one to each of the boys. (pg. 184) \\n In the book Harry tries a spell that the Half-Blood Prince has written into his potions book. He had no idea what the spell would do. It was a non-verbal spell meaning Harry had to think the spell, not say it aloud. Harry pointed his wand at nothing in particular and thought the spell. Ron yells and everyone woke up, Ron was hanging upside down dangling by one ankle. Harry used the book to find the counterspell and thought it. Ron fell down in a heap on his matress. Harry uses this spell at least one more time later in the book. Hermione is horrified when they tell her the next morning. She thinks it is irresponsible to use spells when you don\\'t know what will happen. Later when Harry uses another spell on Malfoy he is horrified by what happens. Luckily, Snape comes and saves Malfoy from dying. (pg. 238-241) \\n Apparition Lessons, they skipped this in the movie, no time I guess. Lessons for everyone old enough to take their Apparition test. Harry is the only one to have ever done it before, but he did it with Dumbledore, not by himself. 12 weeks of lessons, very interesting. (pg. 354) \\n Fascinating piece of news - Harry and Dumbledore have been using the Pensieve to explore memories of Voldemort\\'s past. Harry has questions and Dumbledore will not answer them until Harry retrieves a memory from Professor Slughorn. They finish their conversation with this... \\n \"Was he [Voldemort] after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn\\'t say. . . .\" \\n \"Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,\" said Dumbledore. \"The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.\" (pg. 446) \\n Interesting... maybe Voldemort cursed the position. It has definitely been fascinating to see professor after professor take the job and be unable to go on to holding the job the next year. \\n A small change in the plot occurs when Harry goes looking for Professor Slughorn after he drank the good luck potion. In the movie Professor Slughorn is pilfering plants from the greenhouse, in the book Professor Slughorn is talking to Professor Sprout and has permission to take some plant pieces. (pg. 479) On page 481 Slughorn goes back to the castle, changes his tie, and gets some vials to save some spider venom in. That is not in the movies either, it\\'s a minor change. One more thing from this section of the book... in the movie Slughorn asks Hagrid if he can have some venom from the spider, in the book he sneaks it without Hagrid seeing him, only Harry sees it. (pg. 484) \\n In the book there is a small change to the conversation when Harry and Dumbledore are listening to Slughorn\\'s memory. This part, as far as I remember, is missing from the movie, but in the book. Tom Riddle (Voldemort) is asking how to make a Horcrux... \\n By an act of evil - the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion -\" \\n \"Encase? But how -\" \\n \"There is a spell, do not ask me, I don\\'t know!\" said Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. \"Do I look as though I have tried it - do I look like a killer?\" (pg. 498) \\n I wonder how Tom found out how to do it? Tom already had said that he had looked all through the restricted section of the library. \\n In the first part of the Deathly Hallows Ron complains that Dumbledore did not give them much information on how and where to hunt the Horcruxes, but in the book Dumbledore gives Harry quite a lot of information on what he believes the Horcruxes are.. maybe not where to find them but at least what objects Tom Riddle might have used as he was looking for items with personal or historical significance. (pg. 505) \\n \"So, when the prophecy says that I\\'ll have \\'power the Dark Lord knows not,\\' it just means - love? Asked Harr, feeling a little let down. \\n \"Yes - just love,\" said Dumbledore. \"But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him - and I doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!\" (pg. 509) \\n \"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort\\'s! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! \\n \"But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort\\'s mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.\" (pg 511) \\n Harry begins to understand what Dumbledore is trying to tell them. That there is a difference between required to fulfill a prophecy and choosing to do something for one of many reasons, including the fact that it is the right thing to do. \\n There are some major changes in the scene where Harry hexes Malfoy. In the movie Snape finds them in the bathroom and we don\\'t see much else. In the book, Snape uses the countercurse, lifts Malfoy to his feet and takes him to the hospital wing... then he comes back for Harry. Snape probes Harry\\'s mind and Harry tries to block him out, but is unsuccessful. Snape tells Harry to go get his school books. Harry does so. He takes Ron\\'s copy of Advanced Potion Making. He then took his book and hid it in the Room of Requirement, hoping to go back and get it later. Harry ran back to the bathroom and gave Snape Ron\\'s copy of the potions book. He tried hard to pass it off as his. Snape does not believe him and punishes him with detention every Saturday until the end of term. Snape did not tell him that he was the Half-Blood prince like he did in the movie. (pgs. 523-528) \\n The next departure is very small. When, near the end of the book, Harry and Dumbledore go Horcrux hunting. In the book they go swimming to get to the cave. Dumbledore uses a spell to dry himself off and later dries off Harry as well. In the movie they skip that part and show the opening of the cave and then Harry and Dumbledore appear already inside the cave. (pg. 555) \\n A fascinating change occurs on the Astronomy Tower when Dumbledore gets killed. In the movie Harry hides himself under the floor. In the book Harry hides under his Invisibility Cloak to go and find Snape the help Dumbledore but before he can get out the door someone approaches and opens the door. They shout \"Expelliarmus\" at the same moment that Dumbledore uses his wand to freeze Harry so he could not get into more trouble. (pg. 583 - 584) \\n Now comes one of the large plot changes. It starts with a mention of it on page 585. Malfoy let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. In the movie the Death Eaters come up to the Astronomy Tower and are witnesses to Malfoy not being able to kill Dumbledore but Snape doing the job instead. In the book there is a big fight between the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix guards that Dumbledore has watching over things at Hogwarts while he and Harry are chasing Horcruxes. I guess they wanted to save the big fight scenes for the last movie. I found it to be a very exciting addition to the book. (chapter 28 pgs 597 - 610). During this fight Snape is trying to escape and Harry is trying to use the Half-Blood Prince\\'s spells against Snape. When Snape prevents Harry from using the spells he tells Harry that he is the Half-Blood Prince. \\n Now comes the largest plot change. The students and teachers never use their wands to point toward the sky and honor Dumbledore after he dies. Instead chapter 30 (pgs 633 - 652), the whole chapter, is for Dumbledore\\'s funeral. Hagrid carries him in, there is a lot of crying (I cried too), and they laid him on a white marble table. Everyone was there: the members of the Order of the Pheonix, Percy, Fudge and [annoyingly] Umbridge, Rita Skeeter, the mer-people and the centaurs. \\n My what a sad, sad way to end the book. Tragic. Tears. Great writing. \\n I have other books to read, unfortunately, before I can start the last book of the series. My goal was to read the whole series this year. I hope to be able to make that goal. I still have a few months to go to achieve that goal., addicting, as ever. just don\\'t leave a first edition copy in your room when you live with an overgrown man-puppy. :), I re-read this before going to see the movie. I loved it. It just made me happy to escape into the land of Hogwarts for a little while. I really liked the movie too., I enjoyed this book more than any since the first one. It is a relief to finally get information about Voldemort and his past. It is a relief and a comfort to finally have Dumbledore and Harry in relationship. I am glad to see strategy being employed in the fight and Harry being kept in the know about it. It\\'s nice to see the relationships deepen and mature also. This book seems to mark the turning point for a serious forward thrust in the story\\'s momentum. Boy it\\'s sad though. The ending, though necessary, is tough to read., Though better than book 5, I still found this book entirely too dark to appreciate. The lure of Harry Potter was that it was simple and fun. While Rowling grew as an author, she ceased being as simple, and there was certainly very little fun in this book. Some may hail this as a realistic truth, but these stories were not charming because they were realistic, they were charming because they were fantastical. Beyond that, I fear she only takes into account the darker sides of \"truth\". In reality, the savior of the world would have much more power of influence than she EVER gives Harry, for all her talk about him being famous. \\n The worst part is, however, that books five and six are only \"books\" because they include a school year. They are not at all stand alone stories. The first 3 books could easily be read in isolation of one another. Even book 4 resolved itself by the end, even as it opened a new can of worms. However, books 5 and 6 were nothing but \"building\", preludes of what was to come. Though book 7 was a good book, the pain of getting to it by reading books 5 and 6 makes it doubtful I\\'ll be re-reading the series often... if ever. Also, by making the end of the series so unavoidably adult, it hampers the ability (or want) of parents to share it with their young children. While it may have worked fine for the generation when it was written, having to wait a year or more between books, it will be hard for parents to start a young child on it now. The child will undoubtably be captured by the first three books, and want to read the others, even though few 9 or 10 year olds are emotionally prepared for the later books. Similarly, if parents wait until their child can handle the later books, they won\\'t be as interested in picking up the first couple of \"childrens\" novels. What to do???, I am re-reading the Harry Potter books as part of a group exercise some friends and I are doing. We each chose a book from the series and will go through and write in the margins sharing thoughts, etc. throughout. I chose HBP because it\\'s my favorite book in the series. \\n This is the book that took the series in a completely different direction. It introduced the idea of Horcruxes, made Snape one of the most debated characters in history and rocketed along with lots of humor, fun and a touch of romance as well. Perfection. \\n Re-reading it reminded me why I love the book so much and I fell back into love with all of the characters. The descriptions are great, the humor spot-on and the characterization are what make the HP series shine as well as Rowlings incredible world building. HBP is everything you could want in an HP book and definitely over-delivers. Love it!, Well that was predictably painful. I\\'m crippled by emotions, Brilliant once again., ** spoiler alert ** \\n zweimal gelesen, \\n 1. Mal 27.08.2005 \\n 2. Mal 26.07.2007, First time i read The Half-Blood Prince: Nooooooooooooo, DUMBLEEEDOOOOREEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! (Die Snape, you mother*****) \\n Third time I read it: Nooooooooooooo, DUMBLEEEDOOOOREEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! (Snape, I\\'m still not over it..), Maybe my favorite of all of the Harry Potter books. The loss of Dumbledore was heartbreaking, and for the first time it was made clear that the war between good and evil would not be an easy one, and there would be many losses., Alright so the family got this book when it came out and surprisingly my mom read it before me. I started to read it but as I was halfway through the ending was ruined for me due to a stupid tee shirt and I was so upset I couldn\\'t bring myself to finish reading it. Of course as it came closer to the last book coming out, I had to re-read/complete reading it again. This book is amazing. The mood certainly is changed an immense amount as things start to become more serious, more emotions are involved, and there is more violence, action and turmoil. I was getting so pumped up reading this book, I couldn\\'t help but think \"How are they going to make this one into a movie? How are they going to rate it? It\\'s going to be so amazing but I really hope they can include all of this even though it\\'s really tragic and violent.\" I loved this book!! I can\\'t wait for the movie!, This book never fails to tear my heart to pieces., I\\'m so sad that the series is coming to an end...., Finished reading this with Angie today. I will forever treasure the memory of Angie bolting upright as if she was going to the rescue of one of the characters during one of our reading sessions. \\n I can\\'t wait to see what she thinks after the last book., Great read and filled with many surprises., I can\\'t believe i never listened to these as audiobooks before -they are awesome #teamJimDale, third re-read, oh yeahhhhhh year six, Well, like I remembered, this book sure is about the inevitable march toward doom. Rowling can still make lots of apparently disparate details suddenly come together in some excellent plot, and I\\'m a huge sucker for all the Tom Riddle backstory. And I noticed lots more details this time through. But reading the end bits at bedtime was pretty miserable-making. \\n Aaaand, now I\\'m ready for HP7. I think., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Yes, Dumbledore dies in this very sad installment of the excellent adventures of Harry Potter. Can he take anymore pain? Do we want him to? I loved this book, but I was also saddened to have Harry lose someone else he love. These characters have become so real to us Harry Potter fanatics that we greive for Dumbledore alongside Harry, Hagrid, Ron , and Hermoine., One of My favorites in the whole series., Love., Ya can\\'t say we weren\\'t warned. Rowling said she was gonna whack an important character. \"Half-Blood Prince\" was a really good book and definitely set us up for the last one. It didn\\'t stand on it\\'s on real well though. You definitely needed to be knee-deep in Harry Potterisms to really get into it. I thought the other books held up well on their own much better than this one. But it certainly did what it was intended to do...make me want this last book to get here NOW!, What am I supposed to say...? How do you review this story and do it justice? I suppose, given the emotional hangover I\\'m currently experiencing, my thoughts will be a brief summary: \\n 1) Holy Smokes. \\n 2) I saw it coming, and I still couldn\\'t handle it. \\n 3) Whatver development we get had better be good. Also, the last shred of hope I have, rests on the belief that Dumbledore anticipated the whole affair and things went exactly according to plan. \\n 4) This book was awesome. I love a good, devistating, gut wrenching, climax. \\n 5) Now, leave me alone. I have to read book VII., Finally, a book with direction, purpose, and less crap. \\n It\\'s still got it\\'s moments of \"ah geez, really?\" but overall was good., we near the end of the sage, That was so sad :( \\n I gotta admit that I was reluctant to continue reading after the last book which made me hate Harry, but am glad I didn\\'t stop. For this one was too good!! \\n It\\'s very eventful and full of emotions, I expect nothing but fireworks and \" magic \" from the last book., Again, ;ole the OotP, I finished this a few weeks ago, but the mobile app failed to sync w/ the main site.... \\n Still wonderful to read; perhaps my favorite in the series., This review also appears on BookDigits, which offers a brand new way of rating, reviewing, and discovering books. \\n Grade: C+ \\n L/C Ratio: 30% Literary / 70% Commercial \\n Thematic Breakdown: \\n 30% - Good vs. Evil \\n 20% - Teen relationships \\n 20% - Friendship \\n 10% - Mystery \\n 10% - Magic \\n 10% - School \\n Addictiveness: Medium \\n Movie Potential: 1 Thumb Up \\n Re-readability: Medium \\n Rowling raises the stakes as she builds to the climax of the series, but on its own, \"The Half-Blood Prince\" is a tepid piece of storytelling. The extended flashbacks via the Pensieve are clumsy, and the battles and revelations at the end of the book are underwhelming. Thankfully, the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione remain as entertaining as ever, as their friendship gains considerable depth., LOVE THESE BOOKS wonderful world to get lost in!, I re-read this because Three Cups of Tea was making me cry too much. What was I thinking, this makes me cry too. Dammit., Setting up the mother of all series finales., Oh Dumbledore, you are so wise.... \\n Reading through the series a second time has only increased my love for the stories of HP. This is one of the saddest books in the series, but so much is revealed about what might come. HP is growing up and beginning to realize that his destiny is to fight evil, even to death if need be. As always, his best pals are always by his side, willing to risk their lives for him...and Dumbledore...what can one say? The reader falls becomes enraptured with the fabulous wizard :), Still emotional the second time around, J K Rowling is amazing and these books will always be a part of history. I know that when I have children I will force them to read this! Yes, I said force! I would say I have read this book and the chamber of sectrets the least, not because I did not enjoy them but rather because I was crazy mad about the rest of them. My facourite thing about this book was that Harry finally found love, and as I am a die hard romantic you can imagine my shrieks at that particular part. Harry found himself more in this book and I think the part I didnt like was Harrys\\' particular personality traits while attempting to find himself. STILL 5 STARS THOUGH! \\n Happy reading folks, Wow, this was and amazing book. It explains so much! \\n but it was also very sad. \\n the harry potter books are always so descriptive and mysterious, and i love them!, Amazing! This story was the set-up for the final book in the series. Not only was it suspenseful, but it was also somewhat dark, adding to its appeal., My significant other read this one before me, so we were discussing parts of the book as I read it. During the course of these discussions, we have renamed the book, \"Harry Potter and the Year that Nothing Much Happens...until the END!\" \\n Don\\'t get me wrong, this latest installment in the Harry Potter series is still a well written and engaging novel. It\\'s just that the story does not move along with the same energy as most of the earlier novels. The characters are still well developed and the history that we are presented with in this volume is very interesting as well. I just feel that I could have done with a lot less snogging and lot more actual events. \\n I\\'m not going to ruin any of the twists in this book by going into too much detail, but suffice it to say that I did feel that this was a decent book, it just left me feeling a bit cheated and wanting for a bit more out of it. \\n Oh well, not everything can be a home-run!, WTF, Dumbeldore\\'s death is mostly depressing but in general, the book exceeds expectations and dives beyond any thought, Bravo !, Wow. Not just your usual young adult book series. Something wicked this way comes!, yayyy. \\n It only took me a week to read this book-it was short enough to carry around in my purse, so it got read about a billion times faster than the last couple. The \"emotional work\" that it does is great--suck it, Lavender Brown. The flashback structure is pretty decent. The Draco dilemma is about as good as it could be. The thrilling finale kind of comes as a surprise--and of all the books, this is the one that knowing the plot arc sort of ruined for me--I kept wondering when/if things were going to happen. \\n Finally: For the record, I liked when Tonks was like \"Lupin! I love you!\" and Mr. Weasley was like \"Young and whole men don\\'t always stay young and whole forever.\" Sniffle., This was my favorite of the series... until I read the Deathly Hallows., Maybe my favorite so far, even though it was very sad!, For me, this was the worst of the series. The way television has filler episodes....I think this was a filler book to the series. Yes, the death of a character was devastating, but overall....this book didn\\'t immerse me into the Harry Potter world., Reread in October 2016 \\n I\\'m not sure how many times I\\'ve read this now, but it must be at least 4 times., It was either a high three or a low four. I went with three, as I\\'m increasingly annoyed by the pattern of a very, very long build-up, followed by a climax and ending that take up, at max, about 50 or 60 pages. It\\'s as if Rowling doesn\\'t realize she\\'s got to end the book until she\\'s hit 600 pages, and then decides she needs to quickly wrap things up., I\\'ve been flying through this series and am happy to say I have not become bored or tired of it at all (which sometimes happens when I try to read a whole series back to back). I loved the idea of the Half Blood Prince and trying to figure out who it was. I find it interesting that Harry is feeling a bond with whomever it was...feeling respect and awe for his ability. I also liked how Harry wasn\\'t so depressed in this installment, I am currently speechless. All the feelings. :(, I listened to this book on CD on our Holiday driving trip to Denver. It was sad and wonderful and all the things you would come to expect from the Potter world., I knew it was coming. I knew perfectly well and was prepared. But... it still stung... and it hurt a lot. :( \\n BRB STILL CRYING, Forgive me father, it has been... approximately eight months since my last Harry Potter book. For those just joining in on the wacky world of Shae, this is my first time reading any of the Harry Potter books (EVER), so every time I tackle one, I like to jot down notes with in-the-moment reactions. It\\'s always fun, because I\\'m a weird mix of spoilery knowledge, Tumblr meta, and utter cluelessness. \\n And so we begin. \\n Sneaky Sneaks Sneakin\\' \\n FINALLY, a book that does NOT open with the dang Dursleys. A little weird to break with tradition this far into a series, but I\\'m not complaining. \\n So do Prime Ministers not tell each other squat when they leave office or... Ah. (I found a typo in this scene, too. I gasped, appalled.) \\n \"I\\'ve never seen them so united in my whole term of office!\" said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile. \\n Aw. That almost made me sad. \\n YAY SHACKLEBOLT! I KNOW YOU! I REMEMBER YOU!... But who is Scrimegour? In the context of Tumblr, I mean. Do I know him? He sounds vaguely familiar. Do we like him? He seems competent. That\\'s something at least. \\n Two People In Need Of Shampoo And One In Need Of Tissues \\n And now we\\'ve left the poor, baffled Prime Minister and are with the creepy sisters, Bellatrix and Narcissa. I wonder what this book was like to read WITHOUT the mental image of Helena Bonham Carter. (Am suddenly overcome by a wave of thankfulness that Johnny Depp was never included in the original movies. I can [someday] watch them with a clear conscience. ... Ugh, Harry Potter as directed by Tim Burton. MOVING ON!) \\n Do I feel sorry for Peter? He\\'s a bad guy, but Wormtail is becoming an awful lot like Grima Wormtongue. He\\'s just treated so badly, and I DO hate Snape, so... But wait, what\\'s up with his hand? I don\\'t remember anything happening to his hand. \\n Ooh Severus, you tricky little white boy, you don\\'t actually know what Malfoy was asked to do, do you? ... Or do you? I know, because Tumblr, but do you? \\n Poor Narcissa. I care because I know. \\n SNAPE WHY ARE YOU SWEARING THIS DUMB THING DID YOU ALREADY PROMISE THE GASBAG OR IS THIS WHAT SETS THAT TRAIN INTO MOTION?! \\n Finally, A Harry Is Spotted \\n What\\'s an Inferni? Have we been told this before? What is it with people and jacked-up hands in this book? \\n Dumbledore just gave Harry mead. Dumbledore just gave a sixteen-year-old child mead. Dumbledore is contributing to the delinquency of a minor. (But we\\'ve already established he\\'s kind of a horrible person sooooooooo...) \\n \"Doubtful that I would turn up?\" Dumbledore suggested shrewdly. \\n WELL CAN YA BLAME THE BOY? Don\\'t act like he hasn\\'t been given just cause, you amoral Gandalf impersonator you. \\n How very telling that Aunt Petunia knows Harry\\'s exact age. And let me just say that while I will continue to rag on Dumbledore with outright glee and reckless abandon, I\\'m glad someone has FINALLY given these awful people what-for. \\n ... Zombies? Inferni are zombies? THERE ARE ZOMBIES IN THIS BOOK? I don\\'t know why I\\'m surprised, what with there already being vampires and werewolves and such, but I am surprised. \\n How do I know the name Horace Slughorn? He sounds familiar. Ooh, a Slytherin and Lily\\'s teacher! This should be interesting. \\n \"You mustn\\'t think I\\'m prejudiced\" um yes slugman I most definitely will think that thank you. \\n Why are the girls being mean to Fleur? I thought we liked Fleur. \\n PERCY WEASLEY YOU UTTER GIT TALK TO YOUR MOTHER AND ALSO YOUR BROTHERS BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO DIE IN THE NEXT BOOK (I told you I know things) \\n Sidenote: Is it pronounced Drahhhh-koh or Drayyyy-koh? \\n \"Who blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers.\" Oh the Dramoine shippers must\\'ve had a field day with this. \\n Ginny and Dean?!?!? Is this new?!?! \\n Back At Hogwarts \\n Oh my word, Tumblr is always going on about Draco\\'s obsession with Harry, but they\\'ve gotten that right backwards in this book. This is only page 129 and I can already tell it\\'s going to be a Thing. \\n \"When the Dark Lord tales over, is he going to care how many O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s anyone\\'s got? Of course he isn\\'t... It\\'ll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown.\" \\n Draco is such a Trump supporter I can\\'t \\n Wait, what was Tonks\\'s Patronus and what is it now? And what\\'s a N.E.W.T.? My brain, such a sieve. \\n DUMBLEDORE IS A JERK [Now, as I transcribe this note, I don\\'t remember what spurred it, but I stand by this statement.] \\n \"Take Charms,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.\" \\n How is she not EVERYONE\\'S favorite character??? \\n \"There\\'s no need to call me \\'sir,\\' Professor.\" \\n HE SAID IT HE SAID THE THING \\n Amourtentia or however you spell it smells like grass, parchment, annnnnnd... what, Hermoine? Do speak up. :D \\n Hermoine is cooing over Harry sticking up for her and calling her the best in their year and Ron is ANNOYED and saying he would say the same thing. Looks like the hormone crop is coming in good this year, Ma. \\n Ugh, \"Half-Blood Prince\" is sooooooooooooooooo pretentious. Honestly, that alone is a dead giveaway, imo. \\n Lessons and Lurrrrrrrve \\n Why would a person\\'s memory show themselves? Wouldn\\'t Harry and Dumbledore see a memory through that person\\'s eyes rather than as a third-party lens of sorts? \\n Poor squib Merope. (Have we had what a squib is explained to us yet?) Wait, she\\'s Tom\\'s mom??! Wait repeat, she\\'s a witch?! A squib witch? Is that a thing? I thought a squib was like a muggle, kind of faulty and fritzy. VOLDEMORT IS A MUDBLOOD YOU NOSELESS HYPOCRITE! \\n Aw, Hermoine being worried about Hagrid even if she is scared of his nasty beasties warms my heart. \\n HERMOINE CALLED HARRY \"FANCIABLE\" AND RON GAGGED ON HIS FOOD IS THIS GOING TO BE A RON-IMAGINED LOVE TRIANGLE?! \\n (Who was Hannah Abbott? I feel I should feel sad about her dead whoever, but I don\\'t remember who she is.) \\n The Ron-Hermoine-Lavender love triangle has commenced. Heaven save us all. \\n No one tells poor Harry anything. You\\'d think after six books of this nonsense, the adults would realize this really isn\\'t the best course of action. \\n Oooooh, tiny Tom is already an identifiable sociopath. Jolly good. \\n Harry really is clueless about--Oh! He\\'s not! Not clueless about Ron and Hermoine at all. Thank goodness. I was really getting concerned. Maybe that one Tumblr post overexaggerated. \\n Oh dear heavens, the puberty storm has finally hit Harry. Granted, it\\'s been a while since I read the last book, but I don\\'t think I buy his sudden awareness of/interest in Ginny. \\n Ooooh, a smarmy Hufflepuff (Smith.) \\'Bout time we got one of those. Someone needs to flick him in the forehead. But did Lee Jordan graduate? I don\\'t remember. His commentary was always my favorite part. (Sidenote: Oof, Hermoine is SCARY. And poor, poor pawn Lavender Brown. [Sidenote within a sidenote: I can never spell Lavender right on the first try. Dang second e.]) \\n Yay, Harry/Luna bromance, even if she is annoying! \\n \"Wow, you like your Quidditch players, don\\'t you? First Krum, then McLaggen...\" \\n \"I like really good Quidditch players,\" Hermoine corrected her, still smiling. \\n OOF HERMOINE \\n Wait, does Snape...does he care about Draco? Like, as a person? Please someone link me to meta breaking down this relationship dynamic ASAP! \\n It\\'s Getting Tense-L (Because We\\'re Getting Near The End And Also It\\'s Christmas, Get It?) \\n \"We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful. \\n And so the retconning begins. Don\\'t you worry, Remus, I SHALL CARRY THIS GRUDGE FOR YOU. \\n Why is Fleur being written so rudely? This isn\\'t a simple misunderstanding or a cultural difference. Her behavior right now is flat-out bad etiquette. J.K., whyyyyy? \\n Oh Percy, hug your mother. \\n Harry is giving Scrimgeour what-for in the garden and I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO PROUD OF MY BESPECTACLED CHILD IN ALL MY LIFE. \\n Break\\'s Over, Back To Work \\n \"They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty.\" \\n Look, J.K., I came to this book to get away from certain political realities not to have this freaking description of freaking Death Eater forerunners thrown in my face oh my word. \\n Harry is O B S E S S E D with Malfoy, holy cow. \\n OH NO DOUBLY POISONED RON OH NO \\n Ron looking at freshmen: \"I swear they\\'re getting smaller.\" Realest line in the whole book right there. \\n Trelawney is so racist, I am appalled. I mean, obviously her attitude is not condoned, but geeeeeeeez. Why haven\\'t I seen this on social media? I was not warned. HE IS A BEAUTIFUL CENTAUR, MA\\'AM. \\n This bit with Dumbledore passive-aggressively guilt-tripping Harry about his lack of success with Slughorn has me in a rage. HIS BEST FRIEND ALMOST DIED AND HARRY HIMSELF WAS IN THE HOSPITAL YOU MANIPULATIVE KIDNEY STONE. \\n (Sidenote: The depiction of fat people in this series has me crinnnnnnnnnging. Make it stop make it stop make it stop.) \\n Wait. Stop. Back up. Myrtle... and... Draco? Is Draco the one crying in the bathroom? The lonely, crying, sensitive boy? I mean, I know Myrtle is somewhat delusional but... what? \\n Ah, a Harry-has-Lily\\'s-eyes reference, and before the final book! \\n Why Horcruxes? Why not Horcruxen? \\n Sheesh, Dumbledore brags on himself a lot. Blah blah blah my great talent blah blah blah my keen intellect blahhhhhhh. \\n \"Voldemort has created his own worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how many tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\" \\n Look, J.K., I appreciate this, but really, some escape from reality, pleeeeeeease? \\n IT IS DRACO! HE DOESN\\'T WANT TO?!?! HE\\'S CRYING?!? SOMEONE SAVE THIS POOR CHILD!! \\n \"Then why,\" asked Snape, does it have the name \\'Roonil Wazlib\\' written inside the front cover?\" \\n Harry\\'s heart missed a beat. \"That\\'s my nickname,\" he said.\" \\n AH THERE IT IS! \\n Why are Hermoine and Ginny squalling? \\n HE KISSED HER OH MY STARS HARRY POTTER JUST LAID ONE ON GINNY WEASLEY IN FRONT OF THEIR ENTIRE TEAM INCLUDING HER BIG BROTHER OHHHH MYYYYY \\n Dumbledore is a jerk. [Like last time, not entirely sure WHICH moment I\\'m referring to, but I stand by these words.] \\n Ah, now he\\'s talking about the things Voldemort fears: blood, death, the dark. I know these are common fears, but Voldemort also sounds a bit stunted in the maturity area. Dude\\'s in like his early 60s now or something, right? Get better fears, bro. Level up. \\n Heh. Going in, Dumbledore dramatically splatters the blood-hungry door with the monster cut on his arm. Going on, Harry\\'s like *doink* here\\'s a little forearm scrap. Dumbledore. So dramatic. \\n Okay, so Dumbledore froze Harry so he couldn\\'t move or talk or speak spells, but he just spent the whole book learning how to use unspoken spells, so you think he could\\'ve helped out a little. \\n Ohp. Ding-dong, the wizard\\'s dead. I wish I had been in the fandom then. The anguished wailing must have been delicious. Dumbledore is dead and Snape is hated by all. For this one second, I have peace. \\n Oof, this duel between OotP and the Death Eaters is intense. \\n OOH REGULUS! I SEE YOU, R.A.B.! I KNOW YOU! \\n The use of the Felix to save Harry\\'s friends was a nice little thread wrapped up. I approve. Very clever. \\n Ohhhh. Poor, poor Ponytail Bill. \\n Wait, Malfoy has a shriveled arm? Hand of Glory? What the heck? I don\\'t remember this at ALL. WHAT IS IT WITH HANDS IN THIS BOOK??? \\n Hmm. I feel like the Tonks/Remus thing kind of came out of nowhere. \\n \"\\'Evil\\' is a strong word,\" said Hermoine quietly. \\n I don\\'t know why that quote affected me so strongly, but it did. \\n SO... MANY... DIALOGUE... ELLIPSES..., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I love the romance with Genny! Woo Hoo!, Not as good as the last few books, but hey, nobody\\'s perfect. \\n I think the issue here is that Rowling had to make sure she set up everything she needed for the grand finale in Book 7, and that threw the flow off for this book as a stand alone work. \\n So I will reserve final judgment until after I read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows., Have I read this a number of times? Yes. \\n Do I still cry a little near the end? Yes., Genial\\'no (dubl\\' 6)., picked this up again as a comfort-read. trying to resist rereading the last book before the movie comes out because i know it\\'ll just make me annoyed with the movie., It hurts., I would mark this as definitely the weakest of the Harry Potter books: Harry is much less likeable, his friends are at each others\\' throats the whole time; I was disappointed. It ends with a very smashing climax that makes it worthwhile, but I didn\\'t like most of the rest of it. J.K. Rowling does a lot of things well: high-school romance is not one of them, in my opinion, so this book where that is the focus just didn\\'t do much for me., I am crying so much right now., The Half-Blood Prince was my favorite book out of the entire series. I thought that Rowling did her best writing in this book, she did not over use her characters in situations and I loved the new dynamics that she brought to the table., i love harry potter. i really don\\'t know what else to say! this wasn\\'t my favorite hp book but i still adore it., With this volume, the author moves to a new level of excellence in writing. This novel was dark and difficult to read, but very much worth the effort., the harry potter series is a unique series, in that it uses a lot of the same plot devices throughout the whole series, but no one seems to care. personally, i thought that when Rowling changed the formula with Goblet of Fire, she really hit something nice. but then in Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince, she resumed the typical formula. and im honestly just tired of it. it was fine in the first couple of books. then the third one introduced some new plots that would tie-in with successive novels. but by that time, i thought that she was on to newer story elements. and, there\\'s really nothing wrong with the formula she has, but after six novels, come on! \\n this was a good book. there were some very interesting things that happened, it didnt really drag like Order of the Phoenix did, and there were some great points of emotional tension. but overall, it didnt really change all that much. to many people, this is fine, because many people love and want more of the same, but for me, this is starting to get tedious. its a hard book to rate because i DID like it, and i read the last few hundreds of pages in just a couple of days, but this book trudges along without (to me) that many interesting things until the last two hundred pages. and when i got to the end, even though i thought it was good, it didnt blow me away like i was expecting it to--and you would think that it would, story going as it did. \\n there are times when reading this series, when i dont really know who the audience would be. i mean, they\\'re supposed to be kids books, but as these characters are growing up, Rowling is allowing them to make some shady decisions and is allowing them to say shady things. so then i think, \"ah, maybe this is targeted toward a young adult audience or maybe even the adult?\" but then she doesnt quite commit on the part of the Deatheaters or anything evil. i sometimes have a hard time believing that these evil people are that bad, or even that they are competent wizards at all. you\\'d think that adult wizards wouldnt have as much trouble fighting teenagers still in school, and you\\'d think that these adult wizards who are steeped in the dark arts know more than 3 spells. because Rowling has decided to go a more linear route with her story-telling, the only real characters who get any time on the page are the good guys. because of that, this story doesnt always seem as epic as a story of good against evil really should. \\n but, there i go again, nagging about the things that could be better when it is already a good book. ultimately, we all know that people have subjective opinions about what a good book should be. people are going to read this and give it a 10 out of 5. personally, though i like the series, i think that it largely on the 4 out of 5 star side for the entire series. very much worth your time, but it wont make your want to name your kids Hermione and Dumbledore. \\n i have a strong inclination that the next and final book of the series is going to blow me away. (my hopes arent too high are they??) lol, The beginning of the end. Be sure to have Deathly Hallows/Book 7 (which is really part 2 of this book) ready to go before you start., Book 6 - Harry\\'s story gets progressively darker. There\\'s of course the usual meander through the school year & the Griffinder\\'s claim on the Quidditch cup is as always in jeopardy. There\\'s also a hefty dose of teenage love & angst. \\n A major character dies. Lord Voldamort is not literally present, but appears in flashbacks. I did like this book. An interesting addition to the series., I think this was my favorite of the series thus far. Now going to read no. 7 over Spring Break and I\\'m done with the series! WOOHOO!!!! Chance says no. 7 is the best of them all., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I don\\'t really know what I think of the beginning, since the first two (clearly important) scenes are done outside Harry\\'s frame of reference. The whole point of the books has been that we\\'re in limited 3rd person POV - we find things out when Harry does. That\\'s been the clearly established rule for 5 books, I don\\'t understand why we\\'re changing it in the 6th. Obviously the point of being an author is that you make the rules, but once you\\'ve made your own rules you\\'re supposed to abide by them until you\\'ve also created an exception. That can be done more easily with substantive rules - you can have vampires wander around in direct sunlight eating garlic for all I care, if you say why you\\'re doing it. But a style rule that\\'s been clearly established isn\\'t supposed to be broken, unless you need information that CAN\\'T be conveyed any other way, and I don\\'t see why she couldn\\'t have conveyed the information in those scenes later in the book in the usual way. Okay, yes, it\\'s clearly important that we know about the Unbreakable Vow, but Harry found out about it anyway, so I\\'m not sure why we had to know about it when we did. The point could have been to introduce Narcissa and use Bellatrix again, but I\\'m not sure why we care. Or I guess it could have been that we suspect Snape, which would definitely be fun and games, but I\\'m suspicious of that clearly planted suspicion. My best guess is that we need to know not only THAT Snape made the Unbreakable Vow, but WHAT he vowed to do, and that must have been the most convenient way to do it. \\n Also, I would like to veto love triangles. I know, I know - we have a bunch of 16 year olds of the two genders in constant close quarters, it would be more shocking if we DIDN\\'T have triangles. But it\\'s woeful to have to read it for a million billion pages. And Ron really can be a spectacular McAsshat when he wants to. (Lavender? Really? I have nothing against her, but really?) Although I worry about where she\\'s going with Ron and Hermione - they FIGHT. A LOT. And I don\\'t think that would change that much, no matter what happens...it hasn\\'t been the \"bickering of unspoken passion\" all this time. I think Ron started the snarking of move around Year 4, but Hermione has been thoroughly...Hermione until this year. Also, I kind of like her with Viktor Krum, because it was FUNNY. Although I am surprisingly myself by being a supporter of Harry-Ginny. I heart Ginny and I think she would work well with him. I mean, if it goes bad it will go VERY VERY BAD, as Harry himself as pointed out, but maybe it won\\'t go bad. Maybe there will be ONE THING in this ENTIRE SERIES that doesn\\'t end up going bad. \\n ....Or she could be the one who dies at the end of book 7 WAH VETO. \\n One disadvantage of being a Johnny (jill?) come lately is that I knew that Dumbledore died, just like I knew that Sirius died, but I managed to block that out with the supreme conviction of someone who believes that the bad ending will have worked itself out by the time she gets there. Unfortunately, it did not, and I am deprived of Dumbledore as I was deprived of Sirius, and yea verily I cried. I cried harder for Sirius than for Dumbledore, though I\\'m not sure why - probably because why Dumbledore\\'s death wasn\\'t a shock, how it happened was, and I was too busy screaming \"WHAT THE F!\" at the book to really be emotionally wracked. I had to go back and read it twice just to make sure I really understood what had just happened, because it seemed like there was just no way. \\n So the end.....W. T. EEEEEEFFFFFFFF. I mean, what WAS that? Was it an Imperious Curse? Was it the consequences of the Unbreakable Vow? Or have Ron and Harry been right all this time? And it\\'s so utterly bizarre because earlier in the book I\\'d been thinking about how even though Snape doesn\\'t always like it, in the end he does usually seem to do what\\'s right, like when he made Lupin the serum or when he tried to teach Harry Occlumency-whatever, even though he doesn\\'t like it, and that was what had me convinced that Dumbledore was right in trusting him. And I\\'d thought that maybe if Harry just sucked it up and apologized to Snape and actually tried being polite it might help - like if he\\'d had sorry for his accidental disemboweling of Malfoy. I mean, yes, Malfoy was trying to use the Cruciatus on him, but I\\'d been thinking if Harry just manned up and said to Snape, \"Professor, I\\'m sorry I did that,\" without making excuses, that might make a different. But then after all of that it turns out that HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS HOWARD CHRIST ON A POGO STICK SNAPE BETRAYED THE POTTERS???? and I seriously rethought that idea. \\n And then...and then after ALL of that, has he really been still working for Voldemort this ENTIRE TIME? I mean, I\\'d wondered if everyone circling you for all those years going Dumbledore trusts you but we don\\'t and we just want to make that VERY VERY CLEAR could eventually crack you, and then--wha--wha--what? \\n And Dumbledore DIED FOR A FAKE HORCRUX AND WHO THE FUDGE IS R.A.B.?? \\n My brain has just waved a tiny white flag and crawled into the corner to cry. Dear J.K. Rowling: please cease and desist phunking with my heart., Best books!, Replace all sports broadcasters with Luna Lovegood. Ron + Hermione 5-ever., The previous volume, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was so bloated and overwritten that I shrugged off the release of J.K. Rowling\\'s sixth Harry Potter adventure. Not until a friend loaned me the Jim Dale audiobook for my long commute did I realize that Rowling had come back to form with a vengeance. Of the four supersized Potters, this is the only one that earns its bulk with sheer storytelling muscle. The opening scene with the Prime Minister is a hoot, but the parallel mysteries -- the exploration of Lord Voldemort\\'s childhood as Tom Riddle, and the question of what Draco Malfoy has to accomplish for the Death Eaters -- build superbly orchestrated menace. Horace Slughorn is a great new character, and the hopefulness of young love bursting out all over Hogwarts contrasts sharply with the looming threat of Voldemort\\'s return. The funeral for Aragog -- along with the conversation that leads to a crucial revelation about Voldemort\\'s power -- is a high point of the series. By the end of the novel, many questions have been answered, but only at the price of opening new, scarier possibilities. Do yourself a huge favor and hold off on seeing the movie until you\\'ve read the novel -- the film really bungles the job. I like all seven of the Harry Potter novels, but this book and The Prisoner of Azkaban show Rowling firing on all ten cylinders., Of all the books, this one was my favorite so far. I haven\\'t gotten around to the 7th yet, so keep mum! I hear that one is the best., I cry every time, got all teared up yet again., Installment 6 was as good as the others. The death of another major character was a surprising twist. Well worth the read.., My favorite of the series., Book 6: The prologue to Book 7 \\n Unfortunately, this book did not stand up when read directly after Book 5. Where the Order of the Phoenix dove deeply into scene descriptions, superfluous dialogue, and Harry\\'s interiority, this book steps so far back from Harry\\'s feelings that it could be a story from any character\\'s perspective. The plot, while still being better and more cohesive than some other published novels, was very simple for a Harry Potter book. I would equate the Half-Blood Prince with the complexity of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, only a little more boring because of an utter lack of new and interesting ideas (really, mentioning inferi a million times does not significantly increase the worldbuilding...). This book is the Sorcerer\\'s Stone for older readers. \\n I\\'m looking forward to reading the next book, where stuff actually happens again., Easily the worst book of the series so far. Everything from the changed POV of the narrator from other books in the series, to the over-reliance on flashbacks to drive the narrative, to freakin Dumbledore telling Harry that they needed Slughorn\\'s memory, wasting three months of his training, only to reveal that he already knew what was in that memory, to Snape\\'s betrayal only thirty chapters adter his betrayal was revealed, to the saga of Harry and Ginny that, oh well, lets just end it for no apparant reason. \\n If this was book one, I wouldn\\'t continue the series. But its book six. I don\\'t really have a choice., ** spoiler alert ** \\n D totally got what he deserved. \\n well written, but i don\\'t like any of the characters., Reread \\n For the full review, please visit Thoughts and Pens \\n Finally, the second to the last installment of the boy wizard\\'s amazing story. I\\'ve read this book ages ago but I can\\'t stop re-reading it especially these fast few months. I am terribly missing Harry and the gang. \\n You must probably know by now (if you\\'ve read my past HP book reviews) that I intend to finish reviewing all the Harry Potter series because I owe him big time. Anyway, this is the second to the last HP that I\\'m going to review and I\\'m definitely moving read another series. (Watch out for that one) \\n To start with, the Half-Blood Prince currently holds the number 4 spot of my favorite Harry Potter sequels with Prisoner of Azkaban holding the top spot. I have mixed emotions about it, not in a negative way though. I don\\'t know whether I\\'d be happy with it or be heartbroken when JK finished one of my favorite characters. That\\'s a spoiler, I know, but it\\'s necessary to be able to convey my review for this book. \\n Going into the specifics, there are a lot of things I like about HBP. Number one is that JK Rowling didn\\'t fail to give us another jaw-dropping twist and mystery in this book that by the end, I was breathless like a trout out of water. \\n Second, it answered some of the questions that have been hanging in books 3, 4 and 5 but leaving a slight cliffhanger at the end...just enough to make everyone happy and thrilled to read the last book. \\n Third, the oozing teenage romance of our young heroes made my heart flutter and my stomach queasy with anticipation. And I totally admire that JK portrayed it in a funny, wholesome way unlike some other books out there that takes advantage of the whole romantic angle in an attempt to save the book. \\n Fourth, I love how JK Rowling chose HBP for tracing Tom Riddle\\'s life history. It was very well timed and did not feel like the whole Riddle\\'s story was inserted to make the pages longer. \\n Fifth, JK Rowling\\'s consistency with the characters, their interactions, and dialogues have always been a reason to look forward in reading and re-reading the books. There was never a time that I didn\\'t smile every time a sarcastic remark or a punch line is delivered. And to emphasize this, I love the new character introduced in this book, Professor Slughorn. He\\'s an outrageous, overenthusiastic glutton that dots on Harry every opportunity that he got. Maybe an older version of Colin Creevey? \\n Sixth, I just love everything about HBP: the more serious tone, Harry\\'s obsession with what Draco\\'s up to, Slughorn, Harry\\'s unashamed credit taking for his new potion brilliance (at least he\\'s being authentic. Ha!), Ron\\'s newly found hobby (snogging in public), Harry\\'s moment of finally finding the right girl (spoiler), the lessons with Dumbledore, and Riddle\\'s life being dissected. But there\\'s one thing that made me mad about this book. WHY? WHY does Jo need to be sadistic in taking something that we all learned to love? Isn\\'t it enough that we are completely in pain for Harry\\'s past? Isn\\'t Harry\\'s past losses painful enough to feel the need to strike him with another blow? *sighs and cries* \\n To wrap this review, HBP is an excellent spectacle to set the stage for the final book. It tidied up the loose ends from the previous books without spoiling your hunger for the next book. A must-read even for the most reluctant HP readers out there., Favorite quote: \"And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\", My favorite of the Potter Series!, the best quotes were : \\n \"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" \\n \"When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love.\" \\n \"Killing is not so easy as the innocent believe.\" \\n \"Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth.\" \\n \"Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies.\" \\n \"It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love.\" \\n \"There are much more terrible things than physical injury.\", I cried so hard in this book that I couldn\\'t see the pages. \\n I remember after I read this one I just couldn\\'t believe what had happened. This book, and the one before it taught me more about loss than my real life ever has., I picked up the book, because a friend challenged me not to bash Harry Potter out of ignorance. She was partially right. \\n The plot is tantalizing, but may be a little too well built. It is a great children\\'s book. But I found the characters to be quite one-dimensional and the book lacking the drama, overall., I really enjoyed this book in the series. It\\'s at the top with Prisoner of Azkaban. I especially loved all the background information on Voldemort that the movies skipped over. A really fast read and highly enjoyable!, I mentioned before that book #5 was my favorite so far, however, I have to add that book #6 has surpassed book 5 and it is now my favorite. It is my first experience in reading a book that I actually had no appetite. \\n Book #6 is about Harry Potter finding more pieces of the puzzle, this time it\\'s no longer about his life, but about his destiny. With the help of Dumbledore\\'s pensive, Harry and Dumblebore enbark on an adventure witnessing Voldemort\\'s life and his collections. \\n I found this book to be more cerebral than the other 5. The characters matured, the writing matured, and this book completely enslaved me to the point of missing meals and not caring. \\n The most unfortunate part of reading a series well after it has been established is I often run across \"spoilers\" as I have with book 6 and the ending. Although to my advantage, seeing the title of book #7 I have a clear vision of where the next adventure is headed since I already read a book called The Hallowing a couple of months back. \\n Next..., As books in a series go, this was a very strong one. It fleshed out the back story well., This series is so sporadic with quality it astounds me. There is no real middle ground; I either love, or I hate the book, and I can say for Half-Blood Prince, it\\'s the former. \\n This book is amazing. It has suspense, and romance, and humor, and heart-break, and even with everything going on I wasn\\'t bored! There wasn\\'t a moment where I was waving my hand and huffing because two [or more] characters were taking a billion years to figure out the obvious, nor were there spots where I was growling at the characters for being idiots. \\n Also, without spoiling anything, I\\'m gonna hint real quick here...You all should know by now how much I love love-stories that have been budding and growing for YEARS (years, people, YEARS!). And we see that here... And this makes me very happy. :3 \\n All in all I REALLY enjoyed this installment in the series, and I\\'m very much hoping the next one (the final book) won\\'t disappoint.. I like to end on a bang., This novel is my favourite in the darker (later) side of the series, without a doubt. Order of the Phoenix was long and often frustrating (Umbridge), and Deathly Hallows has it\\'s flaws, in my opinion. Half-Blood Prince, on the other hand, had all the elements that I love in these books: the Hogwarts atmosphere, school-related problems (on the lighter side) as well as exciting mystery and secrets revealed (Who is the Prince? What does Dumbledore want Harry to figure out about Voldemort?). Even rereading this novel, I get caught up in anticipation even though I already know what happens. Still, this isn\\'t like Chamber of Secrets with a happy ending, and there is sorrow and pain that the characters deal with. This novel is more mature, and this added complexity makes it a great young adult novel., The best book in the series! Amazing!, Another great story by J.K. Rowling!, reread may 2011: this is the first thing i read on my kindle. thank god for pdfs! i haven\\'t read a harry potter book in over two years (this is saying something as i have read several in the series three times now) simply because i didn\\'t want to carry the book around (i do most of my reading on trains to/from work). i am forever impressed with these books though. having seen the movie at many times, i didn\\'t expect the battle of the astronomy tower and the trip to recover the locket to be nearly as unnerving and exciting a read as it was. \\n orignally read july 2005: harry potter and the half-blood prince really is the darkest of the series -- the word slut is used! shocking! inconceivable! page 365! that plus, you know...all the dead people and evil stuff., It\\'s awesome. Rowling\\'s mix of coming-of-age and fantasy works really well. I won\\'t go so far as to claim that if you don\\'t root for Harry and Ginny you have no soul, but... well, okay, let\\'s just say this: I want a visibility cloak, too, dammit! Yeah, let\\'s just leave it at that., Harry Potter has just turned 16 - it is his last year as an underaged wizard and his first year that he knows, really knows the significance of the night his parents died and he gained his infamous scar. Dumbledore collects Harry from his Aunt and Uncle\\'s house and explains to them the trying times and the significance of him staying at their house. He then takes Harry to meet Slughorn - the new Hogwarts potions teacher and we experience Dumbledore using Harry for the first time. Through out the book Harry is continuously pushed into adulthood - he is no longer regarded as the boy who luckily survived but is counted as an equal with Dumbledore and other members of the order. A book of betrayal, answers and more questions. We dive further into the past of Voldemort to really understand the sort of person Tom Riddle started as to become the Dark Lord he is today. How will Harry stop him? Neither can live whilst the other survives. \\n Read more here: \\n http://www.thoroughlyread.com/2016/09..., So first off the confession: I am relatively sure this was my first read through. I remember the night this book came out. I went to the midnight event with a friend even though I didn\\'t have a book reserved. I remember when she came bursting into our room into the whee hours of the morning sobbing that Dumbledore was dead (honestly if you don\\'t know it yet it\\'s not my problem). I\\'m relatively sure I watched the movie. Okay so yes I am still fighting off the last of the sniffles. I have not watched or read anything about the seventh year I\\'ve only heard things. Things like that Snape was good all along and the crazy fan girls were vindicated. I looked at Ben at one point tonight and said I will never like Snape. He is like the brutal soldier in movies who hates everything and enjoys the fighting. He might be fighting for the good guys but the hatred still boils inside you. If Rowling manages to when me over in number 7, well she has already earned her fame. Oh I do have another confession! Even though I knew the story of this book I totally forgot that the Half-Blood Prince was Snape! I can\\'t imagine the next book honestly and so I will cut this short and go disappear. \\n (This is the sixth book of the Harry Potter series.), You can read my full review at Quieted Waters. \\n I wrote in my review of the first book, \"I struggle to remind myself that Rowling is writing to a child audience at this point. I\\'ve been told her writing matured as her audience did.\" That perception has proven true, and Rowling has grown remarkably in what were previously weak areas in her writing., Seri Harry Potter paling kelam dan menyedihkan., I cried my eyes out!, One of the better ones in the series., I say it now, for the record, on May 17, 2007: I trust Snape., I\\'ve been spoiled a lot about this series but not about what happens at the end of this one. Which means it all took me by surprise and I cried like a baby. And then I talked to my boyfriend about it and started crying like a baby again. I need a break before I read the final book. Also, Harry/Dumbledore in this is what makes it for me., didn\\'t read all of it because dumbledore dying is not something i can handle right now, Re-read in 2016. Cried. Again. This might be my favorite., Book 6 continues the story with more great details. Love this series!, Great and in trigging story, Call me crazy, but I still believe Snape\\'s gonna come through., Review from previous reading, Dec 31 2008: \\n This book gets sticky for me at a few places. When Harry\\'s kind of too busy stalking Draco to think about anything else he really got on my nerves. Bleh. \\n But other than that it\\'s actually one of the most engaging of the series...which is saying something. I love the parts with Dumbledore in them. Even moreso than in any of the other books - Dumbledore is hilarious. He\\'s truly at his best when faced with death. I also like how he get short with Harry in this one, finally acts more like you\\'d expect him to and less...patient all the time. \\n Seriously, anyone who reads this and immediately goes into The Deathly Hallows? I don\\'t see how you can dislike Dumbledore. After a long break....maybe. \\n But I just love the characterization. It brought a lump to my throat every time someone mentioned Sirius, too, so it wasn\\'t just Harry. ;), ** spoiler alert ** \\n As expected, grows on you with pace and revelations in Lord V\\'s transformation. Surprise elements are distributed throughout the volume and keep you hooked. \\n However, as much as Harry and Ginny pair looked natural, Ron and Hermoine coming together still looks very forced. Ron is too much of a cry-baby still to deserve her :D, Amazing even more so this second time through. Dumbledore through and through Loved all the happiness and relationships in this book. I loved the look into Lord Voldemort, Snape and Draco., Reviews will be after this month due to conflicting schedules \\n Note: \\n Already read two years ago, but because I just remembered to check, so there it goes., Brilliant as always. One of my favourites in the series., I really liked this book. So far, it was my favorite of them all., Compared to the other books, this one was my least favorite. However, I rate this book very high because it is well-written and part of a haunting series that will always be in my heart., I don\\'t think I would have picked this book up to re-read on my own. But teenaged daughter provided me with the perfect excuse to visit Hogwarts once again :), I finished it again, July 24th 2009. I\\'m going to see the movie tonight. I hope it will be as good as the book., by far THE best harry Potter book, This is probably one of my favorites in the series. I couldn\\'t put it down during the last 200 pages. I\\'m quite sad I only have one more book left!, Really loved this one! I\\'m sort of glad I watched the movies so I don\\'t have to hate on snape that bad. \\n That ending tho!, Read aloud with Lover. Very angsty. Had to move on quickly to the last one., This is actually one of the best books in the series. I loved its sad ending but I know that it is very crucial in the story. Oh well, kudos to Ms. J.K. Rowling!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I enjoyed this one, but it really seemed to jump to its conclusion rather quickly. I mean... come ON! Dumbledore should\\'ve been *much* tougher to kill than THAT!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n This book is all about the friendship of Dumbledore and Harry as well as Voldemort\\'s sordid past. It\\'s not as dramatic or quick-paced as many of the other books, but it does help build the final novel. Voldemort is made a little more human and the ultimate way to defeat him is revealed. I think it was a good move to build up the villain more so he\\'s not merely a caricature and you can understand what ultimately drives him. \\n By far the best scenes in the book involved Harry\\'s good luck potion. I think that JK Rowling\\'s occasional humorous bits add a lot to the series. The scenes were further enhanced by the lovable goof, Slughorn, who has the enthusiasm of Lockheart, with a bit more wit. I found his character charming and entertaining. \\n However, I didn\\'t much care for the Ron and Hermione in-fighting in this book. For one, Ron asks pretty despicably in smooching Lavender throughout the book. Hermione ends up rather sulky and the least helpful out of all of the books. I missed having Ron and Hermione in on the adventures even if I understand why they could not be a huge part of them. \\n The biggest twist was Malfoy\\'s seeming reluctance to kill Dumbledore. I\\'ve always though Malfoy was rather one-dimensional. Having him become more reluctant and nervous throughout this book and DH was a welcome surprise. \\n I think that overall, JK Rowling makes Dumbledore and well-rounded, nuanced, and likable character. So it is a shame and a tragedy when he lets him go. However, I didn\\'t quite get the emotional punch from his death as I did with Harry and Sirius. Harry does seem to mature in this book, but he\\'s a bit too solemn perhaps at the end. Overall, a bit more exposition than any other book, but with some fun touches., My favorite book of the series., The only thing I didn\\'t like about this book was Dumbledore\\'s death., After being out a week, I found the time to read the book. Like the previous Harry Potter books, The Half-Blood Prince was a quick read. As I was reading it, I found I was missing much of the suspense that was present in the previous novels. I kept on wondering when the crisis was going to happen. It is not until the last 100 pages or so does the crisis occur. \\n I am not saying that nothing happens in the book. Much time is spent developing the characters further, but the most important role of this novel is the development of the plots running through the entire Harry Potter series. You learn more about Voldemort. Snape and Malfoy are developed further. Romances blossom. \\n However, I would have to say that of all of the Harry Potter books, this one suffers the most of being a middle book. The end does not resolve much other than Harry, Hermoine and Ron are going off to hunt down Voldemort. The sense of completion the other books had is not present in Half-Blood Prince. Even the situations with Dumbledore and Snape are up to debate, and you will not know until the next book. \\n The book was well-written. The characters interesting. The plotting was just different. I would recommend reading it. If you do not have the time though, wait until the next book is about to come out, that way you do not have to suffer the suspense of waiting for the end of the story, cause you are not going to get it here., One of my favorites!, This one breaks my heart, That\\'s a grown-up book, I may say. It\\'s a dark book, really, which makes it very interesting. We discover a lot of Voldemort\\'s and Harry\\'s past, it\\'s so full of detales and which and every detale makes us understand the whole story since the book 1!, As always for me hp is a great read!, the darker these books get, the better they become., SO MUCH BETTER. Wow. The difference between the 5th and 6th books is just incredible. I don\\'t remember liking the 6th book this much the first time I read it. I think it has something to do with my perspective and my appreciation of the characters and the humor. I think this might be one of my favorites of the series. You can really see the development of the plot and things are starting to get deeper and more interesting. I\\'m a sucker for anything involving a pensive, gotta love those memory flashbacks!, Yes, I am finally breaking down., This one satisfied my secret admiration for Snape! It was at this point I was convinced of the truth about Snape, but had to wait an agonising time to find out that I was right in the final book., This book is a must read for ages thirteen and up. I say ages thirteen and up because this book involves magic and kids under thirteen years of age will not understand about the magic., After the loss of the (admittedly: occasionally interminable) dark psychological tone of the last book, this one falls into a very recognizable \\'plot coupon\\' pattern, which should be familiar to anyone who played D&D or watched Dragonball (we were all 11 once, right?). Of course, constructing the finale around such a simple and direct concept for the ending of the conflict is easy for the author. However, it is formulaic and predictable for the reader, and robs us of actually seeing a physical and intellectual struggle between foes. Of course, this does not mean that they do not strive against one another, but by providing the separation of such a plot device, relocates the entire point-of-conflict to an arbitrary, external point. Thermal exhaust port, indeed. \\n For more on such plot-specific concepts, please enjoy this article: http://www.ansible.co.uk/Ansible/plot.... \\n This book was mainly built to set up the finale, and feels in many ways to be less of a complete story than a \\'second in a trilogy\\', without a real point and ending of its own, and reliant on the final chapter to decide its importance. \\n This is also the book with the greatest adherence to actually surprising the audience with a main character death. At least, it would be, if it weren\\'t unfortunately easy to match the emotional directives given to the characters by the author and recognize that what the author wants us to think shows us precisely what will happen. Misdirection is an art, but it should not have to be a martial one. \\n Long story short, I unfortunately guessed the \\'twist\\' and spent the greater part of this book watching the author try to throw red herrings in my path. A bit disappointing, but still a fairly interesting and exciting tale. The historical and character exploration provide some of the strongest elements in any of her books. It does not quite reach the heights in tone, emotion, or motivation of the last book, but she never does reach that height again. \\n My Fantasy Book Suggestions, Read in two days (possibly even one day- not sure) after being acquired from the Ariel\\'s (former bookseller in New Paltz) release party., Re-read for Halloween 2017, ** spoiler alert ** \\n In a nutshell, this one is about Harry meeting with Dumbledore and learning more and more about Voldemart. He learns about the Horcruxes and travels with Dumbledore to find one. Harry and Ginny become a couple. Malfoy becomes part of the Death Eaters. Harry receives a used Potions book that has a name \"Half Blood Prince\" which we find out later, is Snapes. Snapes kills Dumbledore at the end. Harry decides to leave Hogwarts after the funeral. I have taken my time reading these books because I love them so much. This one was good but there was too much plot that seemed to drag along. I realize it was important to take it all in. There is so much to this story, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all of the characters and plot. The characters are the life of the story. The characters are what keep me glued to each page. The climax at the end is like no other. You can feel the drama, the crescendo that has been built up. Harry, Ron and Hermoine have matured. They are strong and are determined to fight evil until the end. Whatever the end is. Harry is ready for his fight and appreciates the support of his friends. And now, we are ready to begin the final chapter in this wonderful story. Or, am I?, More of Tom Riddle\\'s story, more sadness and danger, more irony and humor, more of Luna (Yay!), more governmental CYA (Ugh!), more muddling through friendships and romance, and an end that manages to be both completely shocking and completely expected at the same time. Love it, loved rereading it with the kids! Though I never realized how many sometimes inexplicable differences exist between the book and the movie until watching the movie the day after finishing the book and again the day after that., A lovely reread. First time since watching and rewatching the movie. Two things were better in the movie. The rest is better in the book. Although the movie does make a nice condensed version. I wish they had shown Dumbledore\\'s funeral. The dialogue between Harry and Dumbledore during the drinking of the potion in the cave is much better in the book. Dunno why it was all \"Please\" in the movie. I thought those people knew dialogue. \\n Anyway, there is a lot of reveal at the end that could perhaps have been shown at other points. All in all, a good story. Wonderful characters. Ms. Rowling is very inventive., Too much. Just too much., read 4/28/14 \\n reread 9/7/16, One of the best books I\\'ve ever read. It was revealing how much more first person it is than the movies, which is one treat of written stories, and I understand a bit better just how single-minded Harry can be. Rowling\\'s characterisations are amazing and there\\'s just so many characters to revel in while following the adventure of Half-Blood Prince. Especially loved the budding romance of Harry and Ginny, and hers is a magnificent character, too. If you\\'ve only seen the movie, like I had for a long time, I suggest sitting down for a few nights with this charming, modern classic work of fantasy., The Half-blood prince is not as good as I remembered it. After reading Order of the Phoenix, in my opinion the best of the books on many levels, this one fell kind of flat for me. Of course, being Harry Potter and including a world and characters I love, it was always enjoyable, but I felt that it didn\\'t try hard enough. The opportunities for development were skipped or handled poorly and there was little personal growth. The romance between Harry and Ginny isn\\'t very involving and Hermione and Ron\\'s relationship continues to spiral out to where it\\'s hard to understand why they like each other. Somebody (preferably Harry, their best friend) ought to give it to them straight - you\\'re attracted to each other but it would end horribly, so snap out of it. \\n The best part of this book is the relationship between Dumbledore and Harry, which gets a quick kick before its end. We see a more stern and intriguing side to Dumbledore. A more real site, and it\\'s truly enjoyable. \\n All in all, a solid read., Here, Harry\\'s almost lost everything he\\'s ever loved. Still grieving for Sirius he remains mostly the same. I like that here Harry mostly doesn\\'t have to deal with most of the problems that he shouldn\\'t be having on his shoulder his age. He has a more sense of normalcy than in the other books where he\\'s depended upon., After reading the dull Order of the Phoenix, I really enjoyed HBP. I felt Rowling\\'s voice and style improved greatly. The mystery deepens and intrigues, however, since I had seen the movie prior to reading the book, the ending did not surprise me. I can only imagine how readers were devastated when the book first came out. Quite a shock! I look forward to starting Deathly Hallows., Dumbledore died! Snape\\'s really evil! How is this possible. \\n This is the best of all the books so far. I can\\'t wait for the movie! \\n Wow! That\\'s all we can say., Harry Potter will always be my favorite book series. Half Blood Prince I especially loved b/c Snape is my favorite character from the books and I loved learning bits from his past., This book is where things start to get really scary, and it contains my second least favorite scene in the series. And the author still manages (throughout the entire series) to pull together many different plot lines smoothly. She also knows how to leave the reader wanting more without leaving loose ends., I read through this book so fast just to get it out of the way so I could finish the series, to be honest. This was my least favourite installment. Again, when I read it I was too young to appreciate the conversations telling historical stories about the history of certain characters. Even looking back on the series though, this wasn\\'t my favourite. If it were possible to skip over it and understand the final book, I would have., Loved the series, well written!, I checked out the CD\\'s from the library and listened to this book the weekend after I had cataract surgery and didn\\'t feel like reading. I reallly enjoyed the narrator who read this book. He was excellent, so that helped me enjoy it even more. The themes for The Half-Blood Prince still are too dark for me to fully embrace, but I still admire J. K. Rowlilng\\'s writing. She has more imagination than I can fathom. The crativity of the events and characters is really wonderful. Now I can finish the series by reading #7., Sat on my bed and cried like a little girl., I spent the last week rereading the entire Harry Potter series while I was off from work. Loved them just as much this time., Probably my second favorite of the series. I love the development of Ginny Weasley into such a central character. Part of me wishes for a spin-off of her last year at Hogwarts., For the 32nd time., These audio books are my fav <3, To ekto biblio tes Rowling einai auto pou mekhri ligo prin ten kuklophoria tou 7ou kai teleutaiou kephalaiou tes istorias mas, apotelese enan ekrektiko sunduasmo plerophorion, apokalupseon ki anatropon.

This book stands up really strongly narrative-wise and devastated me far more than it did when I read it at release. It\\'s also a relief by the end of this book to see Harry approaching peak heroism without all the frustrating angst. Also, hey--last Quidditch write-up of the series, can I get a hallelujah., Reader thoughts: And it gets darker. \\n There are quite a few things I don\\'t like about this book, and it\\'s not because the book is poorly written. It\\'s just because so many bad things happen to our characters. The plotting is still good. \\n Writer thoughts:Dumbledore had to die, of course. The mentor character can\\'t stay throughout the entire hero\\'s journey. Harry can\\'t become his own hero if Dumbledore is always there for him. I suppose Dumbledore could have been incapacitated another way, but then the next book would have been about saving Dumbledore rather than stopping Voldemort. Maybe Voldemort could have kidnapped Dumbledore and kept him in a coma or in stasis in some way? Maybe to gloat over? Kind of like a Han Solo carbonite freezing. It\\'s happier, but that has other problems., I remember why I started reading Harry Potter series even after watching the movies. It was this one. This was the first movie which I never understood completely in the series and which was by far then the darkest. I feel satisfied now. J K Rowling is in my list of best authors now and she is well placed, I know. This book is written so well and details each event and character in succinct way which movies could never do. Maybe words are a more powerful media. Anyways, the depth it has added to all the characters and the Harry Potter fantasy world finally makes me a Potter fan. I can proudly say so. He is a strong hero and a powerful symbol of so many virtues that Rowling has been conveying and sticking on to throughout the story line. I think Harry Potter books can teach kids and adults alike about values humanity should hold on to despite anything. \\n .. to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never fully eradicated... \\n A must read., I started to ready this books again, and they are just addicting!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n How did the house elves apparate in Hogwarts? How?!?! Also, I thought it would have been Voldemort that was the half-blood prince. Wasn\\'t it established earlier that Snape was a pure blood? I suppose we were all just kidding with that? \\n Still enjoyed it. One more to go!, category: book over 600 pages, The best of the series so far! A thrilling read. I\\'ll be waiting on line at midnight next week to buy book 7!, It\\'s amazing how long I can take to read a book half this size, but an HP book I can blow through in a matter of hours. \\n I swear, the first two times I read this book, I didn\\'t like it very much. Third time, a couple of the scenes between Harry and Dumbledore choked me up. This time, I thoroughly embarrassed myself systematically losing my shit every few chapters. I still have a lot of problems with this book, sometimes Harry is a little too snotty to be palatable and the plot gets weak in points, but Harry Potter books have an inherent, insatiable charm that always hits me right in the feels., I really enjoyed this re-read. I think this is my favorite of the series. And then I watched the movie. That was good too. I just love snape!, re-read (audio) 7/07, wtf jk rowling, Reread this for the movie and I am so excited!! It should be totally awesome! I love this book. Such an improvement from the fifth one. I have to say this is right after the 3rd HP book in my list, then 7, 1, 4, 2, and last number 5. Loved it. I hardly remembered reading it the first time, which was when it first came out. I think I finished it in two days and was so shocked by the ending that some of the other things that happened completely left my memory. As a sixteen-year-old, like Harry in the book, I think I understand a lot of it better. Harry grew up so much since The Order of the Phoenix. Great book, hope the movie has even a fraction of the amazingness., I feel like my soul just got trampled on. I haven\\'t cried this much since Augustus Waters happened., If it weren\\'t for the romance subplots, which I still hate (sorry Jo), this might be my favorite book of the series. I love the backstory on Tom Riddle, and learning about the horcruxes. That\\'s pretty much all I have to say :P \\n I don\\'t know if I\\'m emotionally prepared to read Deathly Hallows now. Aaah., Resumiendo, aunque creo que no me he enrollado demasiado esta vez solo os puedo decir lo mismo de siempre en estas entradas de la saga, que son libros perfectos para iniciar a la lectura aunque sean gordos a medida que avanzas vas creciendo tambien. Y que obviamente no hay objetividad que valga porque todo es subjetivo y mas si soy yo hablando de Harry Potter o la gente de mi generacion. \\n Leer mas en: http://paranoiasrikanna.blogspot.com...., Harry Potter is Amazing and J.K. Rowling can do no wrong!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I tend to think of this volume as an interesting, almost quirky point in the Harry Potter series. It continues the dark tone set by Order of the Phoenix, punctuated by near-deaths, macabre happenings, and the brutal loss of a beloved character. It also effectively serves as the first part of the series conclusion, with the pivotal, much foreshadowed war between the forces of good and evil well underway. However, unlike the books directly before and after, much of Half-Blood Prince hearkens back to the first books by focusing largely on the daily happenings at school. \\n Rowling continues to have much of the action that impacts the story\\'s climax happen in the drawing room. While some take issue with this, I have found it to be an interesting and effective way of ensuring that the story is told primarily from Harry\\'s point of view, so that his surprises are also the reader\\'s surprises. This is handled in a better fashion than in my favorite volume, Goblet of Fire; while the end of that book made the behind-the-scenes action more noticeable, Half-Blood Prince unfolds more gradually, with periodic acknowledgments of the other side\\'s shadowy actions and a conclusive final gambit. \\n This book also echoes the exposition-heavy feeling of Order of the Phoenix. As less kind reviewers have pointed out, a large portion of this book is dedicated to Dumbledore showing Harry bits and pieces of Voldemort\\'s past. On its first reading and as a standalone book, this makes for a somewhat slow and meandering plot, but I feel that it makes sense in context of the entire series. The fourth book introduced the grim direction of the story\\'s second half, the fifth book gave insight into the good guys, and this one gives insight into the bad guy; now the reader is ready for the conclusion. I very much enjoyed the peeks into Voldemort\\'s backstory, as they helped make more sense of the character (rather than dismissing him as being evil for evil\\'s sake). Also of note is the reflection of Harry\\'s predicament from the previous book; whereas before he was determined he knew what to do and was proven unfortunately incorrect, this time his instinct is correct from the beginning, and nobody will listen to him. Both instances prove to have dire consequences (the least of which is Harry\\'s irritating teenaged sulking and yelling, which I have to admit is authentic from a character standpoint, even if it bugs the hell out of me). \\n The most refreshing part of Half-Blood Prince, however, is the return to the charm and levity of Hogwarts itself, even with the sinister undercurrent. Most of the action in the book takes place in or between classes once again, and the serious business of the main story is broken up by Quidditch, classwork, and young romance. This feels like a final acknowledgement of the relatively benign setting introduced in the first Harry Potter books, and it instills the same mixture of nostalgia and wonder that those books did. Furthermore, it makes the events of the book\\'s main story more jarring and emotional, as they occur over and around both the light-hearted magic and everyday teenaged conundrums of Hogwarts, and culminate in a direct assault on both within the school itself. \\n Of course, any discussion of this book would be incomplete without covering.... \\n ...SPOILER.... \\n ...the death of Dumbledore. This falls neatly within the confines of the version of the monomyth that Rowling has heretofore created; with Dumbledore gone, Harry loses his mentor and last confidant, and is therefore as prepared as he\\'s going to get to venture forth and defeat the villain, which is what he immediately sets out to do in the last chapter. While Dumbledore is given Rowling\\'s usual abrupt death scene, he is also given a touching remembrance through character reactions and an elaborate funeral, which serves as the setting for Harry\\'s next decisions. The impact of his death is immediately and profoundly felt by both characters and readers, especially considering how much time was spent during the book endearing the reader to Dumbledore. Always a whimsical and comforting character, even with his aura of power and authority, Half-Blood Prince establishes his benevolence to the point of laying it on a little thick. Nevertheless, his death leaves a palpable feeling of uncertainty as Harry prepares to face Voldemort and kill or be killed, setting just the right epic tone for the end of this book and the beginning of the final volume. \\n I found that I liked this book much more the second time I read it, just like Order of the Phoenix. The characters are fully realized by this point, and react to situations in more realistic ways. Half-Blood Prince strikes an interesting balance between the fantastic and the macabre, and while not perfect from a story standpoint, it does a fine job of maintaining the overall story arc\\'s rhythm. This book also connects loose ends and throwaway moments from previous books into brilliant character and story setpieces, revealing Rowling\\'s penchant for grand designs and planning ahead. Further, if you are an unapologetic Harry Potter fan like me, Half-Blood Prince serves as an examination of some of the series\\' most interesting characters (Severus Snape first and foremost among them). On to reread the finale!, These books don\\'t need much of a shout out really, we\\'ve all seen the movies. Although of course the books are a hundred times better. J.K. Rowling takes you on the most incredible journey with twists and turns all over the place. Nothing is as it seems. I\\'m quite jealous of J.K\\'s imagination. She has a gift of bringing to live, each of the scenes and sometimes bazar situations. Would quite happily read again and highly recommend., Rowling swung back from a very disappointing #5. The story comes to life again, and there are no end of surprised and emotional roller coasters. My one complaint: I do wish Harry would not always be right about everyone. I wish Rowling would show that it is human nature to be mistaken occasionally, and sometimes we misjudge people. That is my only beef. Well written, lovely book. Can\\'t wait to finish the series., Loved it. I got it opening night and I dove right into it. I think this one was a little darker and more mysterious for me than the others but I just loved it. Great tie in with the other books., I would\\'ve given it 5 stars but the ending disappointed me. I loved the beginning and the middle, but it felt like once Dumbledore died, things just stopped being exciting (except for the funeral scene. That made me cry.). For instance, I wish she would have spent more time addressing the Half-Blood Prince once their identity was revealed. It was the title of the book, after all. And the way the book just ended abruptly was disappointing too. Overall, though, I did enjoy the book and I\\'m excited to start on the last one., This book is dark and not much happens, most of the actions is from the looks back they take into memories. We learn about Tom Riddle and why he became who he became. This one is interesting and extremely sad, I cried., Definitely my favorite book in the Harry Potter series thus far. Gripping. Amazingly creative author., I haven\\'t gotten into the Harry Potter craze, and I know to all the devoted wizards and witches, I will have demonstrated the worst kind of treachery. But, alas, I can\\'t change my actions. I have read the 6th Harry Potter without reading any of the previous installments (gasp!). I tried to read the 4th book, without success. I really didn\\'t get into the tri-wizard contest, and the quidditch game in the beginning of the book did nothing but bore me to tears. However, I have always enjoyed the movies and have gone to see them all. \\n The 5th movie, which I\\'ve just recently seen, finally succeeded in piquing my interest. This is the only one I\\'ve seen that has made me curious enough to act. I had to find out what happens next in the saga! \\n So, I found myself at our neighborhood library, exercising my rights to book borrowage. And I have to say, I loved every word of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. It was everything that I would expect from all the attention the series has received: creative, riveting, shocking . . . endless food to the hungry imagination. I still don\\'t feel compelled to work my way backward, but I will read the 7th book and find out how it ends. (gasp, gasp!) I apologize to all of you Rowling-ites. I beg your pardon. =), I would review this book but I\\'m sure you can find reviews by other people that would be more informative., one of the most suspenseful of the potter books., http://kathleensbookreview.blogspot.c..., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I\\'ve always felt that this is the book where shit gets real. \\n This keeps with Rowling\\'s habit of upping the ante the older her characters (and her readers growing up with the characters) get. It\\'s fantastically well written and enjoyable. \\n I don\\'t remember if we get full details in \\'The Deathly Hallows\\' on Snape\\'s betrayal, but I\\'m going to be pissed if there\\'s not. :), 2nd reading., So beautiful and so cruel at the same time., I really liked this book! \\n We got to know more about Tom Riddle\\'s story, wittness Dumbledore and Harry\\'s bond *____* and also Snape\\'s UNDYING LOVE for Lily....OMG!!! It can barely be resumed in this \\n BUT I seriously couldn\\'t get over Harry\\'s obsession over Draco \\n whome I\\'ve grown to like! \\n How couldn\\'t I after seing him go through so much \\n And then came Dumbeldore\\'s death (which was for nothing at the end). I know He would have died anyway but still.... \\n I was \\n Anyway this book was a real rollercoaster!, Half-blood prince is probably my second favorite book in the series. Deathly hallows being the first. I liked how snape was FINALLY dark arts teacher and i really liked slughorn\\'s character! in this book you can really see everyone is grown up, everyone looks so different from the last book, not only physically but in personality. Everyone is more...open. You see the hormones are kicking in and romance is in the air. You see the \"romantic\" side of the now teenagers. Things get tougher and tougher and Dumbledore\\'s army is stronger than ever., It has been a while since I read the fifth volume of the Harry Potter series and I have to admit that I had forgotten about how amazing and captivating these books are. Even though I had already seen the movie, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince never got boring..., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I had read spoilers about Dumbledore\\'s fate before reading this book, so that wasn\\'t so surprising. But at the end of this book I wasn\\'t on Dumbledore\\'s side at all. I thought he pretty much deserved what he got by ignoring what was very obvious about Snape\\'s predictable betrayal. I suppose, in hindsight, I felt how Rowling wanted me to feel, so good job on her for manipulating my emotions correctly. That makes me like the book more after finishing the series, but I wasn\\'t very happy after reading it at first., Very briefly, I thought the 6th book in the Harry Potter series was just average. This is mostly because I felt that 90% of the book was exposition. Not a whole lot of action happened until the last 100 pages or so. The exposition was necessary in setting up the last book of the series, which it did very well, it just got boring at points. A necessary but unexciting Harry Potter book., *reread July 2017 via audiobook*, I had to revisit this one after watching the movie for the first time. Was the movie based on this book?, HARRY POTTER and the HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series, where readers adventure further into the dark world of Lord Voldemort. The book seems much darker than previous installments; however, it does not disappoint in setting up the reader for what is to be the epic finale to the Harry Potter series., I think of my ratings as \"recommendation scores\", not really \"quality ratings\". I don\\'t actually think any Harry Potter book would get a 7 on its own merits, given the total lack of coherence in the plotlines and dialog that fits, well, a children\\'s book. But with that said, it\\'s fun to experience the phenomenon... it was fun to buy these the night they came out, to see the movies on opening night, etc., and that deserves a 7 right there., *4,5*, Truly magnificent!! The darkness deepens and Harry & friends rise to the forces of Voldemort. A sad piece, too. My heart aches. \\n Last one next., rGm \\'ny knt bkrh ljz lsds dh lm qr\\'th fy l\\'wl, lkn b`d qr@ lrwyt bltrtyb .. \\n ljz `bqry f`lan wmhm jdan, l\\'Hdth wltmhyd qbl nhy@ lrwy@ knt ry\\'`@, lmHt Hy@ fwldmwrt knt mhm@ jdan, w\\'khyran wSf lHzn b`d mwt syrys wmHwl@ t\\'qlm hry `lyh.. \\n shkhSy@ snb llTyf@ wlty qtlt dmbldwr>> wllh \\'n bHs \\'ny bHb snb `lshn qtl dmbldwr bm \\'ny msh bHb dmbldwr Tlqan :D .. \\n mwt dmbldwr kn mtwq` ly bSwr@ kbyr@ l\\'ny mtwq`@ \\'nh lzm ymwt `lshn khTr hry yhzm fwldmwrt wHdh, mknsh ynf` dmbldwr yfDl `ysh, wblf`l mt qbl lm`rk@ lHsm@ b`d m trk lhry w\\'Sdqy\\'h kl Hj@ mHtjh `lshn ydmr lhwkwrkst wyqDy `l~ fwldmwrt.. \\n wmwt dmbldwr lbdy@ lHsm@ lnhy@ lrwyt klh :3 .. \\n \\'kthr shy y`yb fy lrwy@ dy wlly khltny \\'shyl nqT@ mnh lrwmnsy@ lly fyh lzyd@ `n llzwm, f`lyan `lm hry bwtr `bqry w\\'n bqdrh jdan, wfntzy wmGmrt w\\'kshn msh mHtjyn fyh rwmnsy@ wllh, Twl lrwy@ hry byfkr fy jyny lGy@ m wSlh, wkhlf rwn whyrmywn wmHwl@ tTwyr `lqt lSdq@ m bynhm l`lqt Hb :3 .. \\n lrwy@ fy l\\'Sl knt mftqd@ lHms lly fy kl lrwyt `lshn khTr tmhyd lm`rk@ l\\'khyr@ bkhlfyt fwldmwrt, lkn \\'n \\'n \\'ml\\' Hms lm`rk wlqtl wl\\'kshn lly fy kl rwy@ blrwmnsy@ l\\'wfr lly HSlt fyh knt \\'skhf Hj@ fy lrwy@ dy wlly khltny \\'khd wqt Twyl `lshn \\'nhyh.. \\n fy lnhy@ mzlt mqtn`@ tmhyd mmtz llrwy@ l\\'khyr@ mqdst lmwt :D .., Read this book when it first came out., I\\'ve had this book for years but I don\\'t remember to finish reading it until today. So yay, congratulations to me that I\\'ve finally read it. I now see Harry Potter in a different light compared to before. I\\'ve been very unfair in my judgement against JK Rowling for inflicting pain on Harry Potter and he\\'s just sixteen years old. I know this a work of fiction but who gets to experience a series of emotional events in less than a year of your godfather\\'s death. It is just too much!, Better the second time, I found this book utterly pointless. It was just a little bridge between the fifth and the seventh. All it did was tell us about horcruxes. That was the main point. I don\\'t even get the title, since there\\'s barely anything valuable about \"the half blood prince\". Oh well., I can\\'t wrap my head around it .... :(, I was very very close to crying, but I held it in because I was standing in line waiting to get on a plane and I didn\\'t want people to ask any questions., I have to say I absolutely LOVED this book! The Goblet of fire is still my favorite but this book is in second place so far. Very in depth on certain characters. Just great!, Rereading the Harry Potter series. Forgot how intensely emotional this book is. Ready to read the final installment!, Ah, that damn old fool. I have to give it up to Harry for having great instincts and for fighting for what he believes in and for his best friends for putting up with that hero complexion of his (I mean where he wants to take the world all on his own). Got to prepare for the waterworks in the next book., one of my favorite series., Everything up to 80% was interesting, but slow paced for me. After that......., Rereading this book was wonderful. It\\'s still tied for my favourite with book 3 despite the end. It\\'s the last book that takes place with some normality, and I like that. Yet Harry and his friends are older and the stakes are higher than they have been thus far. There\\'s also a great mystery winding its way through the storyline, and that keeps it interesting the entire time! I really need to go to Harry Potter World in Orlando..., This is a phenomenal series! This is definitely up there as one of my all time favorites! The characters throughout the series are lovable, and it is so much fun to see them grow over the course of seven books. The world-building is some of the best that I have ever read; the readers can absolutely get the feel of the school grounds and the wizarding world. The writing is also amazing! I love how JK Rowling develops this story into a darker, more intense plot toward the last few books while still keeping a fun atmosphere to the story! Definitely recommend reading this series, or re-reading like me! \\n For a more in-depth review on each individual book and movie, check out my book blog, A Nook of Blankets and Books! \\n http://anookofblanketsandbooks.blogsp..., \" wqty b mrg y trykhy rw bh rw myshym fqT z nshnkhthhst khh mytrsym nh chyz dygh \" \\n z byn tmm khtbhy hry ptr chh dwr wl khwndnm chh dwr dwmsh yn khtb rw b fSlh z bqyh khtb byshtr dwst dshtm. grhhy dstn fwql`dh bwd, dhhn adm rw khwb bh bzy mygrft w `lwh br ynh Hsst admh rw khyly khwb twSyf khrdh bwd. shyd dlyl ynkhh jld shshm rw ynqdr byshtr z bqyh khtb dwst drm, pr rng bwdn dmbldwr bwd. dmbldwr ykhy z bhtryn shkhSythy dstny bwd khh shnkhtm w rwlyng rw bh khTr tlshy khh b`d z tmm mjmw`h bry tkhryb wjhh dmbldwr khrd hychwqt nmybkhshm. \\n wqty khtb mykhwnm jhyy khh khtb drh bh khwnndh Tl`t zydy mydh rw khyly dwst drm. ynj yn tfq twy dydrhy hry w dmbldwr w grdshshwn twy qdH ndyshh ftd. yh jwry bh sr`t yn bkhshh rw mykhwndm t sry`tr Tl`t rw bbl`m khh mjbwr myshdm brgrdm w dwbrh b`Dy tykhhh rw bkhwnm! drst mthl wqty khh wnqdr gshnhy khh lqmhhy Gdh rw tnd tnd frw mydy w yhw glwt drd mygyrh! \\n fSlhy akhr khtb brm wq` Gmnkh bwd. ydmh Hty dwr wl nmytwnstm wn wq`h rw bwr khnm w ntZr dshtm twy jld hft m`lwm bshh khh Hqhy dr khr bwdh w wn sqwT z brj njwm hychwqt tfq nyftdh. shyd shhzdh dwrgh ykhy z tthyrgdhrtryn khtbhyy bwd khh khwndhm. b`d z tmwm khrdnsh Hdwd ykh hfth Hlm grfth bwd w dshtm bh zndgy w mrg w msyry khh twy fSlh khwth byn twld w mrg Ty mykhnym fkhr mykhrdm. hmyn ln dwst drm bry wn fSlhy pyny gryh khnm... \\n hry ptr w shhzdh dwrgh ykh khtb jdhb, pr khshsh, khndhdr, Gmnkh w dr khl trkhyby z `shq w tnfr bwd. hmyn \\n \" sntwrh nyz bry dy Htrm amdh bwdnd. anh wrd fDy bz nshdh bwdnd m hry anh r mydyd, skht w by Hrkht, nymh pnhn dr syhh ystdh bwdnd w khmnhyshn z shnh awyzn bwd. hry yd wlyn sfr khbws mnndsh bh dkhl jngl ftd; bry wlyn br b chyzy rw bh rw shd khh dr an zmn, wldmwrt bwd w bh yd awrd khh chgwnh dr brbr w ystdgy khrdh bwd w chgwnh b dmbldwr drbrh jng mHkhwm bh shkhst ndkhy ps z an, gft w gw khrdh bwd. dmbldwr mygft bsyr mhm st khh khsy bjngd, w dwbrh bjngd w bh jngydn dmh bdhd zyr fqT dr yn Swrt st khh mytwnd plydy r dwr ngh dd, gw ynkhh hychgh bh khly ryshhkhn nmyshwd... \" \\n swm frwrdyn 1395 \\n -------- \\n nwshth shdh bsyr pyshtr: \\n wy yn khtb hry ptr khyly khwb bwd ! chqd pr strs bwd ! ydmh b`dh tmwm khrdnsh dshtm wrd \" skhtwm smpr\" rw tmyryn mykhrdm !

I can\\'t believe this. That\\'s the most absurd thing ever. No wonder there\\'s so much of Dumbledore in this book. I thought it was weird having him around more than ever. Their meetups also show how patient Dumbledore is and how a good wizard he is. And then you kill him!! I am so mad at Severus Snape I can\\'t. He was pleading to him. Dumbledore was pleading to him \"Please..Severus..\" and you AvadaKadavra him!! How dare you!! How dare you!!! We need to find Snape and kill him now please. Now! Urgh I\\'m so mad at him I can\\'t. \\n When I read it, I refused to believe it. I thought Dumbledore had some trick up his sleeve like maybe clone himself or anything but when it finally hit me, I can\\'t. His character shouldn\\'t have died. But what Harry said in the end is right, he is now all alone without any adult or parent figure to stand between him and Voldemort. This is how it should be. He have to face him alone. \\n Initially, I thought this book is kinda a fallback after The Order of Pheonix but the ending takes it all. I mean the book was kinda...not slow..but focuses on mundane things too much even for Harry. What\\'s with his suspicion towards Malfoy that seems childish sometimes, the love stories between them, the half-blood prince book, the private lesson with Dumbledore, etc. But like I said, the ending takes it all. \\n Btw, I really like how Harry got together with Ginny. It\\'s like sort of happen but in the right way and they should totally not break up at the ending though I think they will get together again soon in the final book. Oh no it\\'s the final book already!! I can\\'t do this! I\\'m not ready to leave this world. NO!!!! \\n --------Edit after almost 12 hours------------ \\n I am still so mad at Snape right now. I can\\'t believe Dumbledore died just like that. At the hand of the person he trusted nonetheless! Such treason! Snape should not ever be forgiven no matter how remorseful he is after this. But even so, Dumbledore died still believing in good in people. He still trust Snape even to the last straw. \\n If you must know, I haven\\'t watch the movie before this. I think I only watched the first few and the final one. And I never really pay attention to the spoiler cos I always try to avoid one as much as I can so Dumbledore\\'s death came as a real shock to me. I\\'m just few years late lol. And the movie, Oh my God, it is so dull! It doesn\\'t do any justice to the book! The book is so full with feelings all the time but the movie lack of those. Until the end of the book, Harry is still full with anger and fury but in the movie, Harry goes like \"Wow I can\\'t believe how beautiful it is from here\" like =.=! And there was no Dumbledore\\'s funeral!! And Ginny made the first move in the movie! I really like how Harry kiss Ginny first out of the heat of the moment. Oh well., This is by far the BEST book of the series. I\\'ve read it at least 10 times., This is my fave Harry Potter book., See my comments on Book I, Tentang buku ke-6 ini. \\n Saya menangis darah karena Dumbledore meninggal dunia. Dumbledore itu lho! \\n Saya masih menunggu buku ke-7 atau cari sendiri nanti hehehe. Btw, buat yang suka Harry Potter *toss*! Buat yang tidak suka dan menganggap ini hanyalah buku petualang anak-anak biasa... ya tidak apa-apa. Saya tetap suka Harry Potter dan harus tambah 1 koleksi lagi hingga komplit! Thanks J.K. Rowling., I cried and cried and cried at the end. As a gigantic Harry Potter fan, I am a little biased but I would advise you to read this book as often as possible :), How had I given this book anything less than 5 stars??? I can see why this book is a favorite among Potterheads (I just learned this word). This was my third time reading it, but it had been awhile (2005, 2007, 2016). Also just found out about HP#8 coming out this summer, so clearly I chose a wonderful time to reread the series., Still good., re-read, The last few chapters where reread several times! I couldn\\'t believe what was going on!!, Amazingly written., While I read this years ago, I just listened to the audiobook version and ended up liking it way more than I remembered. Seriously, I heart J.K. Rowling so very much and it is quite impressive that this book made me tear up on my way to school., BITTERSWEET! MY HEART IS BROKEN INTO A BIZILLION PIECES! 3, ** spoiler alert ** \\n This is a difficult book because as in most heroic journeys, Harry has to face the death of his mentor. I enjoyed the whole \"Trust Snape\" or \"Snape is evil\" debate this book introduced. I\\'m so happy I was right about Snape. It was interesting to see him finally teach his favorite subject as well as Harry\\'s own confidence (borne out of having been one of the best DADA teachers at Hogwarts, even if it was on the sly) with Snape. Slughorn is a great character, too., I\\'ve loved all of the HP books., ah. sooo sad. i cried. great book. just another great work from the mind of JK Rowling, Harry Potter, excellent., An entirely new captivating world-loved it!, Jackson gave it a million quadrillion stars. \\n Oof, this one was rough. Reading aloud lends so much more emotion. \\n Starting No.7 in anticipation of THAT amount of emotion :/, I love Ron and Hermiones relationship. I like how it\\'s starting to really show how much they like each other. I liked how personal relationships are built up more in this book. I feel like this book and book five are just so Harry and Voldemort can grow so they can at last fight to the death! However, I still loved them both :), Listening to audio books at double speed can get you through a tome like this much faster., This book doesn\\'t get old., *pretends to not cry*, More readable than the last couple of books in the series., This book was great but it really feels like a set up to book #7 (not that there\\'s anything wrong with that.) This book has a devestating ending that I just did not see coming., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Fantastic book, yet again. Nothing else to add. Nice to learn a little more about Snape, and the aftermath of some significant deaths., Loved gaining insight into Snape\\'s past. This book made him my favorite character of the entire series., The feels.. oh gosh.. Dumbledore\\'s .. no. no.. \\n (Can\\'t make a proper review. Gotta go attend to my poor feels..), I wasn\\'t sure I could make it, but I wrapped Book 6 this morning (frankly, I don\\'t recall actually turning the last 300 pages of the book, the plot line moved along that fast). Tonight I\\'m on assignment, covering all the Harry Potter parties in town for the paper, and I have to say a few late nights these past 10 days was worth it to be as curious as the rest of the lot on what happens to our dear Harry and his gang of merry pranksters in this final book. Who\\'s with me????, loved this book but going to miss old friend. looking forward to the next installment., I\\'m so devastated and broken-hearted, one of my favorites!, The Plot thickens !!!, I red this book before I went and saw the movie. Probably pretty helpful. I got to imagine those who havent read the book and tried to see the movie were confused., 15 days of reading this, hahaha, Started out thinking...this is a very long book...and at the end thought...I wish this book was longer! Soooo good!, Another good installment., The only reason this one didn\\'t get 5 stars (like the rest of the HP books) is that I felt so unsatisfied when I finished it. Come on, book 7!, My favorite out of the series so far. Probably because it seems to be the one most different than its film adaptation., Really sad! Professor Dumbledore was dead at the end of this book!!! I could hardly believe it..., I excitedly anticipated the release of this book. It really begins to give information of the past and where the end is heading. I tried to slow my reading to make it last longer, but that didn\\'t work too well. I caught myself feeling guilty that I didn\\'t take in other, perhaps more character building, books as voraciouly as I would these books., I liked this one a lot. It\\'s great to finally know the background of He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named. I\\'m furious with Dumbledore for trusting Snape. Why was he so retarded?? It wasn\\'t hard to tell he was still working for Voldemort ever since the first book. \\n I\\'m still hoping that Harry gets with Hot Hermione., ** spoiler alert ** \\n \"Dumbledore tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it!\" \\n I enjoyed this book, but there were large parts that were boring and harry was rather annoying. Of course he was right about Malfoy and Snape and no one would listen to him. The last 100 pages were great; a lot of action. When Rowling is on she is a great writer. \\n I don\\'t understand the reason behind killing Dumbledore. He trusted Snape. At the close of the novel there are more questions and nothing is resolved. Why did Snape do it? He is really a Death Eater. Will Voldemort kill Draco since he wasn\\'t the one who killed Dumbledore? I am hoping these questions will be answered within the pages of the next novel. \\n Hermione was really weak in character this time around. She whined about Ron and Lavender and was not happy until they broke up. Had she not been crying in her Pumpkin Juice perhaps she would have found the Half-Blood Prince was Snape. It makes sense since he was the potions teacher for so long. After the sectumsempra spell in the bathroom against Malfoy, Snape demanded to see Harry\\'s book. I think he knew Harry was using his old book; especially after that spell. However, had Hermione figured out who the true owner of the book was Snape could have been better observed. She did have it close though with his mother. \\n I finished this book last night and I am still in shock, disbelief., I don\\'t care what you think of me, this book is damn good., I think this is my favorite Harry Potter book so far., Read it like 4 times., Re-reading this was amazing! Ginny seriously rules. The Weasley Twins joke-shop is one of the best parts of the book. I hope the movie does it justice - but I doubt it will. Oh and Ginny\\'s pygmy puff\\'s name is Arnold. hilarious!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n After I was horribly disappointed with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I took a year to read book 6. Book 6 was back to form, Harry wasn\\'t a moody, whiny teenager and the plot was fast and engaging. I really enjoyed the back story of Voldemort. I\\'m a little disappointed that Snape and Malfoy behaved exactly as they had been set up to behave all series. I had hoped they might have a redeeming moment, and they may yet, but it\\'s kind of like reading a murder mystery only to find out the red herring really did do it. \\n ******Spoilers****** \\n Why is it that I can\\'t believe when characters die in this series?? I\\'m still not convinced that Sirius is gone. I guess I believe Dumbledore really did die, but it lacks the emotional punch that it should have had. I think it\\'s because they\\'re wizards and they should be able to wave their wands or mutter a curse and save themselves. \\n Anyway, I can\\'t wait to get my hands on book 7 and see how it all ends. Too bad it\\'s got to wait until after I can read Mockingjay!! ;), I loved this one far more this time. Definitely one of my favorites in the series., this is my favorite book of the series, cause i\\'m a big sap and i loved all the dating and making out (except ron and lavender, yuck). this was also my favorite movie., Love,love,love,, My favorite book in the Harry Potter series!, My review can be found here: \\n http://www.bookbunnys.com/2013/02/08/..., This book was amazing! I just love all of the backstory that we don\\'t get in the movies., Although HP is still exciting J.K Rowling is running out of new ideas. The sixth book provides us exactly what to expect a stepping stone to the ultimate fight between good and evil. I loved the fact that J.K wove in our own dark period of the last decade. Ultimately, I still love the series even if this book was an overture to the main production which will come in book seven. At times, I regret my reasoning to read each book before the movie, but surprisingly I have had no one tell me too much about them before I did read them. (Until you Sam). Hopefully I can wait till 2010 to read the final novel., An amazing story of the loyalty of these three friends continued. They stick together through thick and thin as Lord Voldemort gets ever stronger. Harry learns much of Voldemort\\'s past from Dumbledore. In the end what will Harry Potter choose for his final year at Hogwarts? At the end of this book I was so mad I had to wait another year for the final one to come out, I wanted to read it right then! This is an amazing story of friendship, loyalty, bravery, and love. The ending is heart-wrenching and will leave you wanting more., Quite a bit heavier than books previous, and that\\'s not a bad thing., Another great continuation in the series., Definitely the most enjoyable of the re-reads - I don\\'t expect nearly as much from the 7th book. Still too long, but only a little bit. And there\\'s just so much more actual story. And so much more back story - especially around Tom Riddle - and to a lesser degree around Snape. I liked what Slughorn added to the story - as a character, as the dialogue and as to what it says about influence in the Wizarding world. I loved Harry\\'s potions book - but it made very clear the difference between Harry and that author. Harry pretty much creates nothing, invents nothing, experiments with nothing. Certainly its the biggest different between the Harry of the Methods of Rationality. 4.5 of 5., ay., A real tear jerker of an ending but so worth the effort :\\'(, This one was my favorite!, Great book ... again the lose of some characters really upset me :(, Vote: 4,75 \\n Class: L-A2 (FP) \\n (second to last of the Harry Potter saga) \\n Great, just great! I\\'m at loss of words to describe these unbelievable amazing books. \\n I\\'m re-reading the series ten years after the last reading and I\\'m finding it just as wonderful, and I can\\'t wait to begin move forward to the final one. \\n I adore the characters, the beautiful writing style, the story with all its twists. And this is not, definitely, a children book but it\\'s simply put a great book. \\n Like I said before I can\\'t point out what is the best thing about this series but I really think this is one of the best book I\\'ve ever read. \\n Certainly worth re-reading and recommending. \\n One of my all-time best book., After reading this book again there are things that I realized that I hadn\\'t realized before, and I have a few theories. Dumbledore\\'s death always gets to me, and I love how much Harry\\'s disdain for the Ministry has grown. I especially love Harry\\'s exchanges with Rufus Scrimgeour, I find them to be a bit humorous., ** spoiler alert ** \\n The Half-Blood Prince is by far the most intriguing character in the series. Hence, it goes without saying, that a book in his name is deserving of five plump stars. I must, however, express my horror at JK Rowling\\'s romance-writing capabilities. Less than spellbinding, to say the least. But hey, they were fun(ny) to read, so I won\\'t complain., I know, I\\'m more than 10 years overdue here, but this was probably my favorite of the series so far. One more to go!, I forgot how much better the books were compared to the movies...Dont spoil the ending for me!!!, I know that Snape had a reason for everything he did, and we find this out in the 7th book, but his betrayal hits me hard every time. However, it makes me very happy that he does not allow Draco to kill Dumbledore. \\n This entire book is dark. I feel like it is the darkest of all the books. I remember reading it for the first time and not grasping all of it because of that. However, as I got older and read it again (and also once the movie came out and helped), I understood some of the subject matter better and I enjoyed the story better., This was probably my favorite so far. You could see the change in the student protagonists going from children to young adults. You also see the adults treating the students with more respect and responsibility. Best of all, there was a lot of plot progression fairly quickly. I felt book #5 really dragged on and on, and the characters in that book were off-putting (seriously, someone should have put a happy charm on Harry or something). But this book was largely focused on learning more about Voldemort and setting up the end game that I presume the final book addresses. \\n This was one of those books where I really didn\\'t see the ending coming. I figured the big thing that happened to the major character would happen at some point, but I thought she would save that for the last book. And WTF, Snape? Up until the very end I thought he was Dumbledore\\'s man. In fact, I really thought they were going to come out and say \"just kidding. this was all pre-planned. everything is OK.\" But it is not OK. \\n I am eager to finish this book series, In this lead up to the grand finale in the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling ratchets up the tension in another strong installment. \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince deviates a little from the \"formula\" beginnings and endings that we\\'ve come to expect from the series. Rowling also keeps readers guessing about Snape\\'s true loyalty. While...Dumbledore\\'s death along with Harry\\'s decision not to return to Hogwarts but instead pursue Voldemort both raise the stakes considerably. . \\n Bottom line: J.K. Rowling continues to deliver: new characters, intricate web of subplots, and continued development of the core characters with a few surprises along the way., I have just finished Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I am very upset that the author decided to kill off a main character and when the book finished, I realized something that I had know from the beginning. I thought the book was very good but I hated the way it was going toward the end. I had already known that one thing was going to happen, but, I went thru an emotional roller coaster once again and got mad, then I went through a period of hope, but, that didnt last long. I still have a wet face from my tears. Cant wait to read the last and final book, but, I am gonna take a short break before I get into it., I really loved Half-Blood Prince which hit all the right marks with me. The series continues to grow darker although this one, unlike OoTP, does not seem to be mired in it because we get to see the kids distracted by their hormones... great fun! The last few chapters were also terribly intense and left me emotionally spent, I cried like an idiot., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I enjoyed the 6th entry of the series much more than book 5. I particularly like that Rowling gives the readers a taste of Lord Voldemort\\'s backstory. I found it fascinating to see how he went from an angry orphan with a penchant for stealing from and hurting others to a sinister adult with a hidden agenda. This book easily serves as a bridge between Harry\\'s timeline and how Tom Riddle became Voldemort. My only issue with the story is that even though Snape suspects Harry of having the half-blood prince\\'s potion book, he never pursues and/or proves it because Harry hides it within the Room of Requirement. Considering the idea of the half-blood prince is in the title, I figured there should have been more resolve., This is still one of my fav books and if I do not have a new book to read I go back to old favs to get me through the book drought. Love it., I a-dumbledore you!!!!!!! <3<3, I loved this book. It had a great story line, powerful messages, was absolutely hysterical, and had some unexpected romance., Love, love, love this series. Love this books because to me you really get to see the depths of the characters. I think its interesting how the relationships of the characters changed in this book. This was a good read and really grabbed my niece and I!, This was everything I wanted and more. having seen the film\\'s first, it was a pleasant surprise to learn so much about Tom Riddle\\'s past and it\\'s connection to the huge task ahead of Harry. It\\'s so much darker, so much more detailed, I\\'m just in complete awe, and wish I\\'d read them first. It\\'s a step up from OOTP in terms of the attention to detail and the significance of people\\'s beginnings. \\n Not to mention, Ginny is just completely kick ass, and so much more independent, free spirited and feisty than in the films (which my best friend and I agree was a huge let down for the movies) \\n My heart was aching at the end, it was too much. Raise your wands for an incredible wizard., so this one took longer than expected, but its due to the fact my husband and I read these together. Once we started the book on tape (well I-Pod) we were looking for any excuse to take long road trips to finish. While the \"big surprise\" at the end had been revealed to me, how it happened was still a great twist! I love the writing and the characters as always, and can\\'t wait to start the last book. (we have a long trip coming up and already know which book we\\'re taking. \\n New entry. I have now finished this book with Owen and we are on the last and as with all the past he is loving the stories. It is amazing how intense this series is, and I find that don\\'t want to stop reading once he has fallen asleep., I really did not see any of what happened in this book coming - it was the beginning of the end and I loved it. It was amazing to finally learn more about Snape and to be left doubting everything that I thought about him and the story in general before. I\\'m glad I read this when the seventh was already out, otherwise I may have died from anticipation :)., 5/5 Stars \\n Date Reviewed: 13 December 2016 \\n If you want to see more reviews, check out Keep Reading Forward. If you want to see more, check out our other locations as well as here., Reread it again and it\\'s just as good, if not better than the first time., My favorite installment in the Harry Potter series., Great read, Like Order Of The Phoenix, another enjoyable Harry Potter book. And yes, I\\'m pathetic and yes, I cried at the end. What can I say? I even knew it was coming., Best book out of the series! It was (one of) my favorite HP movies as well so that was to be expected, but I think the book added a lot of depth to the story that the movie was maybe lacking a bit (even though the movie is very entertaining). Especially concerning Dumbledore\\'s death (this doesn\\'t need to be marked as a spoiler anymore, does it? XD Come on, you should know this by now) and Voldemort\\'s past. Everything just made more sense in the book and therefore the tension was more palpable. I loved how they develop romantic relationships in this book - makes it feel a lot more Young Adulty, which I like! Ron and Hermione <3 Also, book Ginny is so much more awesome than movie Ginny, it\\'s true. FIVE STARSSSS!, Read (to Greg) Nov 2005, My second favourite HP!, This was one of my favorites of the series so far. The ending has me very excited to read the last HP. I liked that this book had a lot of action and Harry definitely grew more independent as the book progressed!, (Reread June 2016) \\n Still 5 stars!, 9/2016 Re-read \\n The back story of Voldemort is the main theme of the book and what magic he has done to make himself immortal. \\n This and Dumbledore\\'s back story in the next book are two of my favorite parts of the series. I feel Snape was short-changed in his back story. I wanted more than to just understand why Dumbledore trusted Snape. I\\'m sorry, Professor Snape. \\n This book contains my favorite line in the series - \\n \"Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.\", Wow, every time you reread a Harry Potter book you are just so amazed. I love these kids so much, I do not feel there is anytihng about this book that has not been said already. Simply put... read read the series. It is amazing! \\n Also, I will add... this book is pretty much \"the beginning of the end\". You learn a lot in this book about what has to happen to end this \"war\". It is probably the most informative book of all the series in that aspect. \\n Lastly.. RIP Dumblebore. Just saying.... I understand why he had to die. It is critical to the storline but OH SO SAD! :(, I\\'ll make this review short. \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince started with the conversation of the Minsiter of Magic with the Prime Minister of the muggle world (really, I loved this part. It\\'s hilarious haha!) and ended with a breathless moment in the history of Harry Potter series ;) Although the book kind-of focused on teenagers feelings of love, angst, care and whatsoever, it didn\\'t ruin the book because it lightened some of the sinister mood from previous HP series. \\n I will leave this review with an utmost appreciation for Albus Dumbledore. I admire how his usual calm expression guides Harry into a world much darker. Harry\\'s clear dedication still fights with the idea that he could use his magic only for the good and absolutely not for evil. The Half Blood Prince has the best ending in the series so far. However, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Order of The Phoenix will still remain as my favorite HP series ever. :p \\n \"We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.\" \\n -- Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, HUGE shocker at the end!, Another Rowling\\'s best. Well, everybody knows this., As a life-long Harry Potter fan, I\\'ve never claimed HBP to be my favorite. But lately, now that it\\'s been a while since I read the series all the way through in order, I\\'ve found that this is the book (and for that matter movie) in the series that I continually come back to. I\\'m not sure why, but there is something about this book that is intriguing and beautiful. I guess it\\'s because I\\'m the same age as the characters are in this book and I feel so connected with Hermione through her boy drama, I wish I could make birds attack the boys that hurt me, because it always makes me so happy when Hermione does it! :) This book is also one of the only one that\\'s made me cry (I really loved Professor Dumbledore) which gives me another emotional connection to it, so that could also be a reason that I keep coming back to it. So I guess all I\\'m trying to say is that I love this book and Harry Potter in general. Love love love!!!, very good, A populacao magica ficou de sobressalto com aquilo que para Harry ja era, ha muito, um facto inquestionavel: o Senhor das Trevas esta de volta. Munido dos seus fieis Devoradores da Morte, as suas capacidades estendem-se e o seu poder e pleno. O medo e a cautela conquistam cada um, pois a qualquer momento pode romper uma investida das sombras. \\n Consequentemente, este e, de toda a saga, o livro mais sombrio. Percorre-o uma sensacao tenebrosa permanente, o que e evidente no ambiente que envolve as personagens. Os primeiros dois capitulos, decorrentes em locais fora do comum e sem qualquer intervencao dos protagonistas, sao o indicio desse caracter negro. Nomeadamente o segundo capitulo constitui uma cena fortemente intrigante, onde muitos aspectos sao mencionados para serem deixados pendentes, o que intensifica a vontade de continuar a ler para descobrir mais. E, de facto, este e um livro de descobertas. Quer a nivel de personagens, quer a nivel da historia, somos lancados numa espiral cheia de revelacoes surpreendentes. Por esta razao, arrisco-me a dizer que ate ao sexto volume e precisamente o sexto o mais completo de todos, ja que consegue desenvolver tanto personagens como historia com um equilibrio eximio sem haver falta ou excesso de uma das duas. \\n Ainda voltando ao tom negro da obra, grande parte das revelacoes ja referidas contribuem bastante para o mesmo. Porque? Simplesmente porque essas revelacoes estao relacionadas com Lord Voldemort. Em Harry Potter e o Principe Misterioso, somos guiados juntamente com Harry e Dumbledore ao mitico passado do Senhor das Trevas para entender como o simples humano se tornou no feiticeiro mais negro de todos os tempos. Estas visitas a tempos longinquos tem um proposito delineado, como posteriormente fica claro, mas a verdade e que os episodios em que Rowling se propoe a contar parte da historia e do percurso de Voldemort sao a perola ha muito ansiada pelos leitores. As origens peculiares, os primeiros passos dados num mundo magico e o crescimento da avidez por poder sao fases da sua vida que se ficam a conhecer e que com todo o seu obscurantismo patente se tornam momentos unicos e fascinantes. Ainda assim, nao se relata tudo aquilo que desejavamos saber. Ficamos vorazes por mais informacoes acerca de Voldemort, fome essa que so seria saciada com um livro dedicado exclusivamente a sua misteriosa figura. \\n Opiniao na integra em http://refemdasletras.blogspot.pt/201..., This is my second favorite book in this series. \\n Haven\\'t you ever wondored why Lord Thingy (OK, lets call him by his true name, Tom Riddle A.K.A. Voldemort) stays alive forso long? To find out, read this book., It was a cry fest in the end. but indeed a gem in the whole series. loved it., gaK gHettu baGus.. keRenaN buKu yg sBluMnya. Soo, aq gaK jaDi beLi dee.., Why did he have to die? that was not fair!, I loved the interaction with Dumbledore in this book., The \"Half-Blood Prince\" was by far one of my most enjoyable literary experiences. The built up made around the book (with Rowling giving us ample space to guess who HBP was, the podcasts, the theories; it was so charged and exciting) especially with the revelations made here and there about Harry\\'s future was simply breathtaking. A lot of secrets were pushed into the light with this book; whether romantic, strategic or simply ghastly (the sting of Dumbledore\\'s death is still there after all these years), \"Half-Blood Prince\" was so well written in terms of description, story telling, character development and humour that it ranks up there in one of my favorite books of all time., Unabashed Harry Potter fan. Criticize me for it and I will Avada Kedavra you. I kid you not. I was sorted into Slytherin., Book 6 shows JK evolving as a writer somewhat, her ability of fleshing out the characters comes off a bit smoother, which is a good thing. The evolution of Snape is the highlight in this book, he\\'s finally starting to become an interesting character where before he just seemed like a bitter little wizard. Other characters such as Draco and Bellatrix also pick up a bit more depth, but what about the good guys? Well Harry for some odd reason has decided to hit puberty at 16, which is kind of late but maybe nerdy boys hit puberty later on. Not only has Harry hit puberty but he roams around wanting to beat up one of his teammates because he wants his friends woman, how lovely. \\n Besides the silly little machismo angle JK gave Harry in this book, the story is good however. The relationship between Harry and Dumbledore becomes more significant while at the same time, the reader gets to learn more about Voldemort. And well, Voldemort is like the next gen Darth Vader, and a lot more interesting. \\n All in all, not a bad a book at all. It could be better, but if it was it wouldn\\'t be suitable for children., Dumbledore dies in the end....did not like that part at all!! other than that the book is really good!!, Very good. Never a complaint on J.K. Rowling., I felt that this book dealt a bit with how bullying can affect a person as they grow older, as it did Snape. I never liked him much, but I can understand him after reading this book in the series. \\n I love the cat and mouse feeling between Harry and Snape. Neither one wants to be nice to the other...so much like the real world. \\n The mystery of the Half-Blood Prince was cool to me...to take a slight respite from some of the other goings on to concentrate on just WHO it is., Desconozco las palabras requeridas para describir este librasasazo. \\n J. K Rowling como siempre escribe increible. senti que yo era Harry y senti todas esas emociones que siempre admirare la forma en la que estan descritas \\n ALTAMENTE RECOMENDADO, Love it, My fav collection - Harry Potter series, 2nd place :D :D Nice one :) :), so suprising!, This book is another excellent rendering of JKR.. I feel the best of all her books because it more than magic narrates on a level that seems very identifiable and funny at the same time., First Harry Potter book I\\'ve ever read. I went all Star-Wars-kind-of-sequence on this series. Love all the trips down to memory lane, and the movie made no justice whatsoever because of lack of details; I was so furious that they had omitted a lot of important scenes where Voldemort/Tom Riddle was concerned. Definitely a fun read, and one of my top HP faves. I literally cried NOOOOOOOO when [SPOILER!!]the astronomy tower thing happened[END OF SPOILER!!] which Im sure all other HP muggle fans also embarrassingly done also., Great book in an amazing series, The Harry Potter series is the best series I\\'ve ever read. The friendships, their world within our world, the hideous Aunt and Uncle, the enemies, etc etc etc....... The first three books are for kids; I\\'ll agree with that. I\\'m 35 now and when I read them I\\'m a damn kid. It\\'s good to get lost in books like this sometimes. I finally read them in 2010 from my bother\\'s pressure. I\\'ve read them 4 times now and will continue to read them at least once a year, if not twice. I describe them as like \"The Andy Griffith Show\" of books. I know what\\'s gonna happen and laugh at Barney every time. Do yourself a favor and try to forget the movies. I saw the first 6 once and that was plenty. Same review for all these books. The last four are written far better than the first three. But I wouldn\\'t change a thing. If they ever come out with less editing i\\'ll be first in line to read them but I love them just the way they are., i restarted this book... nouf said., awesome, One of those books in a very long series of best sellers which serve as a vital link in the story, but serve little purpose on their own. \\n A lot of breath taking revelations make this book a must read. I cannot mention them without SPOILER ALERT. \\n At the same time the end is rather unsatisfactory. The reader realizes that this is not the end, it is in fact a pause to acknowledge the death of one of the world\\'s greatest magicians. \\n Mrs. Rowling is at her creative best and you start seeing the missing pieces of the picture. And a conspiracy as old as the prophecy which it tries to fight is picture perfect entertainment., My favourite of the whole Harry Potter series. LOVED the plot, loved the development of the characters up to this point and thought this was the most hilarious of all 7 books., Very good book I like it, This is my favourite of all the Harry Potter books. \\n I have to confess that I think that ALL the Harry Potter books are very overrated but I think this book really does stand out. \\n To me the others are a bit predictable and seem to follow a formula but with this book I just couldn\\'t put it down., ** spoiler alert ** \\n J.K.Rowling gives the critical background information on Severus Snape. Dumbledore is killed., This time i finished the book quickly before the movie started :D, sedihh... \\n dumbledore nya meninggal.., A beautiful masterpiece of literature! Bound to be a classic someday!, I am in no way ashamed of the fact that I love reading Harry Potter books like I love my parents - the act fills my heart with joy. This book\\'s not as good as Order of the Phoenix - but it did make me cry - an honor it shares with Steinbeck\\'s of Mice and Men, Sad, but really a good read. Great characters, you believe in them., Snape! Snape! Snape!, Great book. Love the progression of the story., I continued to be impressed with the Potterverse, and the growth of the characters. I appreciate that Rowling never writes down to her audience,and that the themes she addresses are pertinent to all of us, but especially adolescents. I look forward to discovering the ending to the series., Excellent! I was disapointed by who the Half-Blood Prince is but I could live with it. I litterally cried during the climax. This book perfectly sets up the final chapter., Arguing for almost two years that Snape wasn\\'t evil was probably the most fun I\\'ve had in a long while., Want to finish this before the movie. :), Things get really interesting in year six! I think it is one of the funnier books in the series. Until the end of course..., I have just finished this book this morning. Well, I just can say that Harry Potter series is going darker and darker. More people get hurt, more people die, but I still love the way J.K Rowling describe everything in this book. Just can\\'t wait to read the last Harry Potter series., Finished reading this again right before the movie came out. Love this book!!, I am still hoping that Dumbledore is still alive :(, The best book out of the whole series, I think. But for some reason it made the worst movie.. Well, things happen.., Interesting and fun, When I was in eighth grade, I gave Harry Potter its first chance. It was so amazing and J.K. Rowling is an absolute genius. I have never seen a more talented writer with such a wild and well expanded imagination. How her mind came up with such a genius idea I will never know. The way she put romance into the books and didnt shove it down your throat like most authors do was very real and organic. The idea of her books is to get people thinking of the good and bad. Of friends and enemies . Of family and outsiders. The tale she told is so heart warming, it makes you gain an attachment to every individual character. The characters diversity was another one of J.K Rowling\\'s strong points. She did a good job to make everyone different yet still have things that make them connect like real people. J.K. Rowling did so good with discription and character development that she made Hogwart seem like a real place. It seemed she had actually been there and took the classes because of how well she wrote out the story. So I must say, thank you, J.K. Rowling for giving us an amazing story that makes us smile, makes us cry and gives us a place to go to when you want to be welcomed. You are a genius, and Harry Potter will always be a part of my life., This Book was my personal favorite of the series., i like the harry potter books, This book, this book guys. \\n I have to say that the Half Blood Prince is easily my favorite book in the series so far. It dethroned Prisoner of Azkaban as my favorite. The whole story is little more than amazing narrative. \\n This book gives you a large amount of back story on Tom Riddle, the man who would later become known as Lord Voldemort. I loved learning the back ground of him. It gives you the chance to see how this young man became the most powerful dark wizard to ever exist, which is actually kind of odd to look at. In the beginning, Tom Riddle and Voldemort really seemed like 2 completely different people, but by the end, you come to realize that Riddle had always been Voldemort, just without the latter\\'s name. \\n I will say that this story has one of the most drastic changes within the entirety of the series, in my opinion. I won\\'t spoil what that is, I will say that a huge anchor in the series has been pulled. Even though I knew it was going to happen, I still was taken by surprise when it happened. I MAY have cried one MAN tear. I will say that this is one of the most emotionally powerful books that I\\'ve read. It made me feel every emotion from anger, excitement, caring, sadness, everything. I thought the end of Order was emotional, goodness. \\n The characters, what do I need to say? They are the characters that you have come to love throughout the previous five books, the thing that changes most drastically is that you see some serious relationships form between the characters. Whether it be romantic , or any other type. \\n The story really does an exceptional job of getting you not only ready for the final battle against Voldemort and his Death Eaters to come, but it makes you get to a certain level of excitement for it to come. You learn things about how Voldemort has become \"immortal\", how he is maintaining that immortality, and how he can be brought down. I am so excited to see how the last book unfolds, how everything comes together. \\n I give Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince a very, very, very high 5/5., When books/series get heavily hyped it\\'s easy to be disappointed, but Harry Potter consistently delivers. \\n I dare say it\\'s getting better and better, as the more \"adult\" themes are broached. \\n With all the back-story the world is quite rich, and the characters are interesting. \\n On some level I actually care what happens to them. \\n That said, at one point in the early going of this one I thought \"man, this is a long book\". \\n Then, next thing I knew I was staying up to read it (which is rare)., ** spoiler alert ** \\n As the final installments of J. K. Rowling\\'s Harry Potter series come to a close it is curious to look back and see just how far these remarkable tales have come. Following young Harry Potter, the boy who lived, from his humble beginnings in his uncle\\'s house to fining out his destiny and what greatness lies ahead. Fans have been taken on an intense rollercoaster. One that has thrown readers into suspense and shock along with sadness and occasional joy. This six of a seven part series is no acceptation and one could argue the best of Rowling\\'s works yet. \\n Coming from what seemed like Rowling\\'s low point, book five, this novel did not have the highest expectations. However, \"The Half Blooded Prince\" proved to be a perfect mix of the sparkle and delight that filled the first four books yet has stepped up the magic and the mystery to whole new levels. Not only have the characters matured but so has Rowling and her world of Witchcraft. The magic is darker, the secrets are deeper and they all unravel beautifully to keep the pages turning. \\n To me, it becomes easy to see the best qualities of this book by examining the worst qualities of it\\'s predecessor. Book 5, \"Order of the Phoenix\" was long awaited for three years yet was quickly forgotten. The 870 page novel seemed to have a lot of pages just to fill pages and was not an enjoyable read. True, it had some amazing qualities and was core to the overall development of Potter and his journey but once again, not enjoyable. No one wants to read a book were nothing goes right for the protagonist ever! Potter\\'s situation goes from horrible to worse. The ending is even depressing and the likable characters seem to be loosing with no hope in sight. \\n Now, in contrast, the little things Rowling changed from the past novel were enough to bring it from worst to best. First off, as most people noticed, this book is MUCH smaller that the last two (maybe she\\'s not going for the world record after all). Although most fans are disappointed at first with a mere 652, it turns out to be a brilliant alteration. The story goes quickly and there is enough material to keep one interested throughout the pages. Next, for once, things seems to be going well for our little hero. Harry\\'s got the grades, the friends, and even the girlfriend and what would seem to be Harry\\'s worst nightmare, Snape\\'s new position, could have been much, much worse. \\n With all this being noted, we have not reached the truly remarkable aspect of the novel. That which brings it to a clear contestant for being Rowling\\'s magnificence: the plot. Now in the sixth year at Hogwarts, there is little magic that the students cannot perform and even less of the Dark Arts that Harry and his friends have not encountered. The magic is deep and compelling and the range of the mystery grows to satisfying new levels. Beginning the story with a look back on Harry\\'s O.W.L.S the reader is reminded of just how skilled Harry truly is in the Dark arts and foreshadows a relatively good year in school. \\n Quick to draw interest Rowling begins with Harry\\'s adventures with Dumbledore, the two greatest wizards of all time, signifying what will stretch over the entire novel and ultimately be it\\'s core. Even chapter two brings in an unexpected twist when a friend becomes a foe and the questions along with the suspicions grow from there. Now, not to give away too much it is without a doubt the ending that will leave the readers clenched until the final installment. Although the shocking ending of book five was commendable, it pales in comparison to what we see and learn now.... \\n As it was said, the magic is deeper and the plot thicker. Now the once harmless yet incredibly annoying Draco Malfoy has followed In his father\\'s footsteps and all that Harry once knew and trusted would crumble at his feet. \\n All in all one may walk away pail when finished with the book but Rowling ties in a satisfaction of the necessity of her shocking events. She foreshadows what is to come in book seven and ties together the maturity and growth her protagonist has endured all in preparation of his final and sure to be greatest adventure yet..., The fantasy continues in Hogwarts\\'s 6th year/book, that scared me when he meet voldermolts mother and then tells ron and hermione about it but it was a good book, Great!, my first book to go out and buy a real one...and its worth it!!, My favourite book of the series. It shows a lot about the past which always gives us a better idea of why characters are what they are right now. Also, another side of the Dumbledore-Harry relationship is explored and they get even closer. Also, Harry finds love- love that has been consistent for years, i think, and finally bloomed when he noticed her as more than his friend\\'s sister and feels the feeling he never expected to feel- jealousy. He also questions himself about loyalty and friendship and feel the conflicts of a normal teenage boy even though he has the weight of his world on his shoulders. A coming of age book for Harry where he learns to take more responsibility than ever and go through even more loss of his loved ones. He also prepares himself to embark on the journey that he always knew was coming. Love it., Rowling is an excellent story teller! This is the best book in the series. I am not giving a nod of approval to the content of the book, rather, I am judging it on the basis of being a great read., beneran suka banget.. \\n walau dumbledore kudu almarhum.. \\n sedih sih sebenernya, agak bikin masuk angin juga.. mengingat gimana ya caranya air hijau itu dy minum ampe abis buat ambil horcrux nya.., I cried while reading this, Started reading the next book in the series, then Hunter lost interest ... still need to finish it., The best part ever! but sad for Dem\\'s death, mulai beraksi!!, A great book, maybe the best of the harry potter series up untill now, with a bunch of twists and turns; Appeals to just about everyone I can think of. And for those of you who like to buy books by the pound, It\\'s worth the money., Loved the Half blood prince! It was a great story...hated the movie version though, J.K.R did it again!, It is a cool book. something that make me feel very strange .. this feeling make me try to find somthing new in myself., An impressive novel! Very shocking story ending... Really!, I read ALL Harry Potter\\'s volume A LOT., This whole series was great!!!, First of all I should tell you about mugglenet=the best HP fan site ever so visit mugglenet.com now! oh, gosh I sound like a freaking salesperson. ugh. \\n JUST READ THE FREAKIN` BOOK OK!? it rocks =D, I love this book so much! This book kept me wanting more, I am so excited about the movie coming out! This book was a roller coaster of emotion there is sad, happy, love, and anger. This is a very myterious, sneaky book i fell in love with it. This book reminds me of all of my friends in a wierd way, and even some of my family members. I love that finally you find out more about Voldemort and his history other than him just being the cruel, evil bad guy but this book took that a lot farther and I truly enjoyed this book. I would recommend this book to anyone because, I am the tyoe who hates to read but i read this in exactly two days and I think if I liked it I am sure peolpe who love or hate to read would do or feel the same!, Noooo how sad brilliant but very sad, Sets up the plot nicely for the last part., i cried., Nice. Didn\\'t make much of an impression on me though., As always enjoyable and waiting more for Harry Potter stuff. Good read...the whole series., captivatingly engaging, My favorite Harry Potter book :), di buku ini, kalo gak salah ada tempat untuk menyimpan memori. wah...bagus banget kalo aku punya satu ya, I have once again re-read this book. I have been reading Harry Potter since fifth grade. Whith the new movie coming out next year I decided to re-live The Half Blood Prince... and boy does it still bring a tear to my eye. I know that Harry is fictional and all but I just want to give the kid a big hug. Things just do not get any better for him. \\n The characters in this book really evolve. The little kids we see in previous books are growing up and falling in love and everthing is magical. (lol) We also get to see Voldemorts life. I honestly can not believe how corrupt this little boy was, killing to make himself immortal and such. And torturing kids in the orphanage. Crazy. Not that I didnn\\'t expect it of course.. the old Voldemort isn\\'t exactly a saint. \\n Snape. I always wanted to see the good in Snape. Always thought that he was a good guy.. This book makes me want to kick him really hard in the shins. (Obviously opinions can change as we see in Deathly Hallows) \\n Over all I think that Harry is probably the strongest person I know... (Ok i feel like I know him?? lol) With everything that has happened to him, In real life im pretty sure he would be a little corrupt and maybe a little homicidal? Good thing he has wonderful friends! Even if Hermione does nag a lot. This book is a tear jerker, no matter how many times I read it when I already know the ending., Great book. Introduction is very engaging. I enjoyed it a lot. Very intresting and adventurous. Better story than most. Finished it very quickly., Reread. Amazing., \"We Are With You Whatever Happens\" Said Ron \\n This Quote Can Tell You All You Need To Know About Harry Potter in a nutshell, Ron\\'s Brother was just severely injured, His sister almost died and his parents were barely holding on, Even when He knew that His friend had an impossible mission, no destination, and Even when his friend told him that it was not his fight, He did not think about it and just stuck with his friend, \\n Some May say that Harry Potter is just about Fantasy but to me it\\'s about childhood innocence, friendship through Hell and extreme forms of loyalty, \\n Thank You J.K. Rowling, You can\\'t trust everyone!, niceee book... \\n bahasa yg ringan dam cerita yang menarik, Both one of my favorites and one of my least favorite. Don\\'t ask. My favorite paring got together in this book, but, they killed off one of my favorite characters, so... you see my dilemma., My favorite!, Not a review.

In the six installment of the hit series, Harry, Ron and Hermione continued their study of magic at Hogwarts with minor changes. Snape was appointed as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts profession and Horace Slughorn replaced him as Potion Master. The Ministry of Magic, on its part, was also doing necessary precaution now the threat of Voldemort\\'s attacks are expected. \\n Harry had a private lessons with Dumbledore who let him know the Dark Lord through the Headmaster\\'s pensieve. Harry learned the Dark Lord\\'s past including his days in an orphanage. Eventually, he learned that Voldemort split his souls into 6 objects called Horcruxes and he was tasked to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes which may include valuable things from Hogwarts\\' founders. \\n In the end, Snape killed Dumbledore when the Death Eaters attacked Hogwarts. Harry was left to continue the search and to destroy the remaining horcruxes in order to defeat the Dark Lord., ketika sebuah perjuangan menuntut pengorbanan..., Finished readin Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince last week. Another outstanding segment of the Harry Potter series. What an amazing story. I loved it., Seri keenam dari Harry Potter ini semakin membuat penasaran para penggemar Harry Potter. Dalam buku ini, J. K. Rowling memperlihatkan begitu banyak hal-hal yang harus dihadapi oleh Harry di sekolah Sihir Hogwarts, walaupun banyak cewek-cewek yang menaruh hati padanya. Belum lagi, Harry juga tahu bahwa Lord Voldemort semakin kuat setiap harinya. \\n Harry yang di tahun keenamnya di Hogwarts diangkat jadi kapten tim Ouidditch Gryffindor.Tahun ini Dumbledore memberinya pelajaran privat. Mempersiapkannya menghadapi musuh bebuyutannya. Lord Voldemort. Seperti dikatakan Ron. Dumbledore pasti tak akan membuang-buang waktu memberinya pelajaran kalau dia menganggap Harry pecundang - dia pasti berpendapat Harry punya peluang! \\n Harry mengira cita-citanya untuk menjadi Auror telah kandas, karena nilai Ramuannya tidak mencukupi. Namun dia keliru. Tahun ini Snape tidak lagi mengajar Ramuan, dan Harry menjadi yang paling pintar dalam kelas Ramuan - berkat bantuan Pangeran Berdarah-Campuran! \\n Banyak sekali kejutan yang terjadi di tahun ke enam Harry Potter di Hogwarts. Penuh misteri yang akhirnya terungkap! \\n Apakah itu? Jawabannya baca aja di bukunya!, Ehhhh...Dumbledore schmumbledore., I loved it. It was very well written and everything was very satisfing.......expect Dumbuldore dieing.....that part was sad:(, I love all the Harry potter books and this one was no exception. Lots of action and just enough detail. Would recommend it., a planning well marvellous, (See the first Harry Potter), Pertama kalinya baca versi bahasa Inggris (via e book pula). Perlu 3 kali baca baru bisa ngeh apa isinya., One of my favorite Harry Potter books... I loved it!!!!, ... awlnya g tertarik. buku ko tebalnya ky kitab suci ya ... ?, begitu rampung terpikir juga. kapan aku baca ktb suci rampung sekaligus dalam bebrapa hari ? hiks., This book is incredible... It\\'s my second favourite out of the series. I love the whole thing but I feel like the series gets better as it goes on, with the last two being the best. Part of that might be that I\\'m a hopeless romantic, but... C\\'est la vie!, If anyone wants to know how much I cried while reading this, I\\'ve used up an entire box of Kleenex. No kidding., It\\'s Harry Potter - of course they\\'re good... :), This was a great book as well., This is by far my favorite Potter book! Most of the questions are being answered in this book. Love it., This is my favorite book of the series. Everything really starts to come together, and you really get a sense of all but one major character., It was nice. \\n I felt sad when dumbledore died., Love this book!!!, The plot thickens in the Harry Potter saga, I love all the Harry Potter books, but this is my favorite by far. This book has everything, magic, adventure, action, romance (not too crazy on romance). J.K Rowling did an excellent job of this book. \\n Harry Potter Movies: Now, there is some negative critisism in this, but I think the first movie was awesome, the second was great. After that the movies went down hill, they tried to make the movie seem funny. They skip so many things and add some stuff in, I have watched all the Harry Potter movies, but they could have been better., snape\\'s a f****** traitor!great twist in the story...someone also died here., I can\\'t forget it. \\n It was fantastic., Loved it!, The beginning of the end..., Well...its the best one out of the rest, I can t say anything about Harry Potter i loved it!, This book is realy good. I would recamend it to anyone., This was the only book that I waited in line to get at the book store. Possibly because I had nothing better to do, but mostly because I couldn\\'t wait to read this book. I loved it, and again, bawled like a little baby at the end of the book. I had no idea what was going to happen at the end of the series..., The Dark Side of Harry POtter Comes...., One of the most beautiful parts that I \\'ve ever read and the most interesting one , I \\'ve read it in just one day and maybe if I did not previously watched the movie , I would cry a lot at the end and becuz the death of ( Dumbledore ) :( ... It is for sure the best part for the Description and showing facts . I can\\'t wait to read and finish the last book <3, masa matee sich sich tidaaaaak, Seperti buku terdahulu, selalu saja ada kejutan, kecemasan, ketakutan, dan kegembiraan yang datang seperti gelombang, saling mengejar., It\\'s Harry Potter. Need I say more?, The most powerful Harry Potter so far and dark. I am looking to read all the books more closely and read some studies on them. I have a lifelong interest in this set of books as part of my interest in Religious Studies and Mysticism., Wow, how can you not love any Harry Potter book! They keep getting better and better as the series continues... Wanted to read The Half Blood Prince again before the movie comes out this summer, just to refresh my memory and again I was spellbound (no pun meant!)throughout the entire story. There is something about the way JK Rowling writes that is appealing to all ages, so if you are an adult and think these books are just for kids, think again and give it a try, I\\'m sure you\\'ll be hooked just like I was!, Loved the whole series!! I started to read this as a teen because my niece loved them and I fell in love with them too :), Amazing. Is a big part of modern culture. Read it, In the last book Harry becomes a man. Now he matures as one and finds that love can end pain. You see a whole new Hogwarts, and I mean that in different ways. Voldemort is getting stronger everyday and while Harry must prepare for the battle that will one day come, romance finds it\\'s way to their school and is encountered by many. Evil is encountered as well, and betrayal is found among the students and teachers. Dumbledore and Harry take a look at the past and go back to it, if you know what I mean... \\n It\\'s an excellent read. Second best. Recommended highly. \\n Re read April 24, Throughout these books you develop a love for the characters which is why I was saddened by Dumbledore\\'s absence in this book., My favorite in the series., I couldn\\'t get through the first 20 pages. I hated how the beginning went into a lot of detail about the background and it seemed that the actual plot line of the book hadn\\'t even begun. It was too slow for me and lost my interest., I was introduced to Harry potter when I was at a very young age and I fell in love with HP I have read all the books n watched all the movies n I saw HP rocks forever n ever! \\n Everyone has 2 read the series at least 1 time cuz I guarantee u will love it!, This was probably my third time reading this book (the last time was ~6 years ago) and WOW so many emotions. I laughed out loud many times. I almost lost it near the end. But damn I am so happy to be back in this world. Things I love about HBP: \\n -Weasley\\'s Wizard Wheezes \\n -Ron and Hermione <3 \\n -Malfoy\\'s character development omg so good \\n -Tom Riddle\\'s back story \\n -Introduction to the horcruxes \\n -Harry and Dumbledore\\'s transition into being peers, I am a pretty huge Harry Potter fan, and out of the whole series, this book is my favorite! J. K. Rowling is an excellent author and tells such a great story in these books. This one is particularly interesting as Harry grows so much closer to Dumbledore and we get a great look into Voldemort\\'s past. These books will forever be fantastic for anyone at every age!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n THIS WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK! I ACTUALLY CRIED! \\n I cried when Dumbledore died. He meant so much to Harry, and was the person most close to him. Dumbledore always tried hard to rescue Harry, and make him feel comfortable. Personally, this book was awesome because my fav characters are in love. Ron and Hermione. I was also about to cry when Ginny and Harry kissed in the common room and when Bill got bit by the werewolf. I thought Fleur is a very nice and sweet girl. They are a good couple. \\n I trusted Snape. I had always liked him because he was both nice and evil. But I hate him. HATE HIM. HE KILLED ALBUS DUMBLEDORE. Malfoy-I think is actually a nice boy. \\n But I really liked this book \\n HARRY POTTER SERIES ROCK, I have always considered the first three parts of the Harry Potter series to be the best of the series. The seventh part, Harry Potter and the deathly hallows, does match the excitement and anxiety I felt while reading the first three books. Overall, it was satisfactory page turner novel that I could not put down, ever! \\n The first three parts brought in so much innovation in the children\\'s book world: a new magic school, the hidden railway platform, etc etc. But the innovation went dry starting from the fourth part (although I considered the tri-wizard tournament in the fourth part to be an exciting part of the series), and the series went dark and followed just the story of Harry and co try to save the world from evil. \\n The only reason for me to finish the final book ASAP was to know how it all ends. The end was satisfactory, and pretty logical (only because I had deduced the ending by the end of the sixth book), not in terms of whether Harry would live or die but how the questions would be answered (why does the scar burn, etc). And the end was just as a fantasy novel would be finished, a surprise twist given by J.K. Rowling who\\'s like the supreme power of Harry\\'s world. Only she could decide if Harry would live or die, just like the Wachowski brothers put life back into Neo by a kiss from Trinity. The book gave me an impression that the ending was maniputalted to satisfy the readers, and surely the readers must have been a critical factor in considering the ending. So it remained a mystery to me how J.K. Rowling would have ended it all if she didn\\'t have to take the readers feelings into consideration. \\n Although I have given 4* to the book, I firmly beleive that J.K. Rowling could have done a better job in writing the last book, of all books. My point of consideration was that the book turned out to be just a novel: nothing more and nothing less than a story. It wasn\\'t like a lovely fairy tale where children get to learn a moral lesson. Taking into consideration that this novel was read by 15 million people in the very first weekend, it would have done so much good to the growing children if they could have gotten a moral lesson out of it. Being one of the most widely book right now, it could have had a profound effect on many growing minds, conclusively proving that it\\'s just a commercial novel., By far the best book in the series so far. Excellent plot, I liked the twists, and the characters were the best so far. They seem to actually be learning to be better people! I am still a bit disappointed with the characters in general as they all seem to have in common that they are all jerks; however, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville, and a host of others seem to have matured greatly since the last book. Can\\'t wait to read the final book and find out what happens., My favourite, Dumbledores funeral was amazing, Good read, My absolute favorite of the series., di serial ini, jujur adventurenya sedikit, bisa dibilang ga rame, lebih banyak dramanya karena ada tokoh yang meninggal...dan keliatan banget harry potter lagi galau total...sejauh ini komennya cuma hmmm... aja deh u,u, Sad, I\\'m weeping....again..., I think that Order of the Phoenix is still my favorite of the series so far but, Half-Blood Prince is such a close second now, its hard to be sure...It definitely is one of my favorite, if not my actual favorite endings to a book EVER. It is profound and all the time we get to spend with Dumbledore is wonderful and to be cherished...and to end the book in the way that JK Rolling does...it is sad yes...but somehow satisfying and heartfelt...to just be grateful with everything that Harry\\'s been through to have more time with his friends, especially given all that lies ahead, and to be the person he is with valuing friendship and love, while Voldemort became the opposite under similar circumstances...is so profound and powerful...Can\\'t wait for Deathly Hallows and Cursed Child, though I expect to be a wreck when it finally all ends or comes to a close. [?], I Give any Harry Potter book 5 stars... they\\'re just that AMAZING! \\n AND THE MOVIES COMING OUT JULY 15, 2009!!!!!! \\n Check out www.siriusly-potter.com for more,, Wow! I still can\\'t believe that he died! (I won\\'t write who...don\\'t want to spoil..LOL) Why did he even trust that Half-blood prince. I thought the half-blood prince was voldemort. LOL and I want to know who R.A.B. is., If the Harry Potter series was Star Wars, only better, then this would be The Empire Strikes Back, only better., dark book!!!!!!!!, My Favorite one in the series, !Magnifico! Definitivamente ha sido un gran modo en el que la autora nos encamina al epico desenlace de nuestro querido trio de oro. \\n En este libro me gusto de sobremanera que se abordaran temas personales, mismos que les da personalidad a los protagonistas, el hecho de que al crecer tengan intereses en entablar relaciones sentimentales me agrado. Es como ver crecer a un hermano pequeno o un amigo que vimos desde nino y que tal vez sin dar tanta importancia al paso del tiempo es cuando notamos que en efecto, el tiempo ha transcurrido. \\n Los ultimos tres capitulos tienen mucha fuerza y vaya que marcan precedentes para las decisiones que tiene aun por hacer Harry. \\n Simplemente extraordinario. Ya estamos mas cerca del final de una historia que personalmente quisiera fuera infinita., Great book - Rowling really develops a world that both children and adults and understand and enjoy. Harry Potter\\'s story is epic and really helped a generation of children learn to enjoy reading., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Too much death, Kembali ini merupakan salah satu buku Harry Potter favorit saya! Di buku ini, semakin jelas kelihatan bahwa dunia penyihir yang awalnya terlihat damai telah terbelah menjadi dua. Satu pihak mendukung Dumbledore dan Harry Potter, sementara satunya lagi memihak kebangkitan kembali Voldemort. Kementerian Sihir telah kehilangan kendali dan wibawanya. Perdana Menteri Cornelius Fudge pun telah digantikan oleh seorang Auror veteran, Rufus Scrimgour. \\n Dari semua petualangan Harry Potter, ini yang paling kelam dan mungkin tidak bisa diterima para fans Harry Potter yang mendambakan dunia sihir yang lucu dan sempurna seperti di buku-buku awal. Kekuatan gelap semakin kuat dan Dumbledore semakin lemah serta tua. Ia mengajak Harry berkeliling mencari hocrux demi memusnahkan total kekuatan Voldemort. Di akhir cerita, sesuatu yang mengejutkan terjadi. Ya, tidak usah ditutup-tutupi bahwa Dumbledore telah tewas! Bila di nomor-nomor sebelumnya, akhir halaman selalu dikisahkan Harry menaiki Hogwarts Express untuk pulang sementara ke rumah paman-bibinya karena liburan, maka kali ini cerita ditutup dengan pemakaman Dumbledore yang kelabu, disusul ekspresi marah Harry yang menuntut balas dendam. \\n Sekilas seperti: baru tersadar bahwa dunia sihir tidak seindah bayangan..., It was sad to know that the series was getting close to the end when I read this! It\\'s a fantastic book! It reveals a lot of back stories of characters and leaves a huge cliff-hanger at the end. I could hardly put it down!, yay for HBP! \\n the movie is good \\n but NOTHING beats the book!, *sniff* \\n Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is quite a powerful book. Despite it being the shortest of the last 4 BIG books, it is, in my opinion, the most informative and has such a deep meaning within it. \\n A lot of the book, during many chapters, goes into the past of Tom Marvolo Riddle (I am Lord Voldemort). We see in his past life that really he had no love. He is abandoned at birth, feared by every child in the orphanage, and eventually becoming the greatest and most feared and hated dark wizard of his age. While in our focus in Hogwarts, though, we see all sorts of love in varying forms. Ron and Lavender (shudders) then Hermione. Harry and Ginny. Harry\\'s growing bonding with Dumbledore. It starts to show that what Dumbledore says to Harry is true: Voldemort cannot love, which - according to Dumbledore - makes Harry that much more powerful. To me, this is the underlying theme of the book that carries throughout. It\\'s brilliant, really. \\n And of course the ending is just... So hard to get through. It doesn\\'t hit right when Dumbledore dies, but the final chapter is so much to take in. But at the same time, it\\'s written in such a way that there is still hope. That there is still the bonding and love of friendship. It is the most perfect set up for the finale that is Deathly Hallows, and I am so excited to read it for the first time since it came out. \\n As a sidenote, having read all the books already and already knowing what happens in the 7th book, it has been such a thrill to read all these books with every question of the 6 books already answered in my head. J.K. Rowling has created an incredibly solid and well rounded series, because even the reader is able to see the varying answers hidden cleverly within each book., Dark, facinating, kind of disappointed for some reason ^^, I think it was a great book tuns of details and I felt super sad when Dumbledore died. \\n Awesome read, this is an AMAZING book!! its to be expected ofcourse since its part of the Harry Potter series...i love the adventure, discovery, tragedy, (well i guess didn\\'t really like those parts..) and comedy in it! :D, it has been a while since i read this one, but i still remember that i loved it!, tZl mshkl@ khlT \\'sm lmtHdthyn \\n mt dmbldwr myt@ mshyn@ dwn \\'y jdw~ tdhkr Ht~ \\'n t\\'thry bmwt syrys kn \\'kthr bkthyr mn t\\'thry bmqtl dmbldwr \\n sm l`dd lm \\'jd \\'nh tm ltwfyq fy khtyrh flm ykn l\\'myr lhjyn bhdh lqdr mn lthr@ wltshwyq fy lqS@ mn \\'Hdth \\'khr~ t`d \\'kthr \\'hmy@ fy nZry lytm Tlq smh `l~ l`dd \\n jHwd byrsy lmstmr lGyr mbrr wlGyr mqn` `l~ lrGm mn t\\'thr jmy` l\\'sr@ bm Hl bshqyqh byl l \\'nh lm ytm lt`rD lmsh`rh bhdh lkhSwS b\\'y Hl mn l\\'Hwl \\n t\\'thrt bmrsm m b`d mqtl dmbldwr \\'kthr mn t\\'thry bmwqf mqtlh nfsh \\n wlknny fy lnhy@ \\'`trf \\'n lqS@ Htjt l~ qdr hy\\'l mn ltrkyz mn qbl lmw\\'lf@ fy \\'Hdthh wqd Zhr hdh fy khrjh lnhy\\'y fqd jdhbtny bshd@ l~ lan llstmrr fy qrth b`ks slsl@ l\\'flm tmm wlty \\'Hs blHmq@ lmjrd mtb`th, ** spoiler alert ** \\n The cave chapter was the hardest. Especially when Harry is consulting Dumbledore not to worry Dumbledore replying \"how can I ? I\\'m with you\", Mi libro favorito de la saga hasta ahora :), Loved the drama, it evened out the darkness of the story., Too much detail, one would say. J.K.Rowling had written this book after her earlier books started being converted to movies...so now you would find every minute detail described, so that you almost can picturize every scene in your mind. It is like reading a movie. \\n As for the contents, it seems to be a leave the story unfinished, unlike the other books. It does not clearly stablish who actually the Half Blood Prince is. And the expected but sudden death of Dumbledore leaves you shocked. I dont think the last part of the book has been well written at all.. instead it seems hurriedly wrapped up., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Ide tentang Half-Blood Prince nya keren, karakter Snape semakin kuat dan keren, tapi sayangnya cara kematian Dumbledore semudah itu. Nggak ikhlas :(, I loved all Harry Potter books, The twist at the end is fantastic., potter grows up. becoming a man...what?, This a really good book., Im reading it for the second time now and I like it alot. It\\'s all magicky.I am very close to the end and I have liked it alot I would recommend it., Great story, though a little long., amizing,. bikin gw jadi pengen bgt jadi penyihir. could i?, This book was good. I could not put the book down, I was walking around with it. Immediately you learn about the new minister, that Snape is bad(or is he?), that Voldemort is planning something. You learn the reason why Voldemort has been surving, the only way to destroy Voldemort, and the truth about who really sold Harry to Voldemort. Harry has a new interest in this book. He learns about Voldemort\\'s past and gets extremely obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Only one problem, nobody believes his theory(or do they?). A shocking event takes place that no one is prepared to believe., I remember how much I loved the Harry Potter series, and I don\\'t care that some people judged I am too old for that. In my dreams I am still Harry :-), This is the saddest one of them all! Why Dumbledore, why!?? Lavender Brown Oh my gosh type A personality right there! Ron gets his shining moment on the quidditch team! Poor Harry he is now in love with with Ginny, I love them together!, huehuehue..buku ini memang untuk remaja, tapi akyu sangat suka sekali dengan seting ceritanya yang sangat kreatif (buah karya hasil terjebak di dalam kereta selama 8 jam). \\n Di dalam buku ini karakter harry semakin kuat dan petualangannya dalam menimba ilmu kesihiran di Hogwarts semakin seru!!!! Adanya konflik di mana ia lebih mempercayai buku potion-nya daripada kekhawatiran teman2nya terhadap buku yang mencurigakan itu. Dan misteri di balik pemilik buku potion yang banyak membantu harry (I love Prof. Snape). \\n Dan yang paling aku suka adalah (huehuehue), ketika harry menyadari kalo dia menyukai adik perempuan dari teman baiknya Ron (Ginny). Aku selalu ketawa ketika membaca dilema harry akan rasa sukanya dengan ginny. Love can be a monster or make you become a monster. Huakakaka.pokoke seru wae., Quede pidiendo mas., (RE-READ IN JUNE), Favorite Harry Potter book. :), NoooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooOoOOooOooooooOoOoOOOOOOO, Ave Dumbledore., My favorite in the series :), I watch Harry potter\\'s movie well not surprising anymore..haha, ** spoiler alert ** \\n An amazing story for Harry\\'s last year at hogwarts., We\\'re All Muggles in A Wizarding World \\n http://ashleighstonehewer.wix.com/the... \\n Every child across the world will forever hate their eleventh birthday. I spent the day waiting for the arrival of an owl that should have been delivering my letter, and then the night waiting for a half-giant to burst down my door, give my brother a pig tail, and tell me those famous words: you\\'re a wizard, Harry (even though my name is not Harry and I am not a boy). \\n J.K Rowling did not just write a book. She created a world. It is a world that has taken a whole generation under its cloak (of invisibility) and ensured that the magic of words are not lost on those who are at constant risk of losing their souls forever to the real world dementor: technology. \\n The Harry Potter franchise has become much more than a fictional world. It has embedded itself in our reality. The characters have been brought to life by the films; Quidditch has become a real sport--yes, broomsticks are included; and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter means that it is now possible to visit the Weasley\\'s joke shop, drink Butterbeer, and eat vomit flavoured sweets. \\n Harry Potter blurs the lines between fiction and reality; it makes us believe that the impossible is possible. Harry Potter is magic; Rowling is the magician. \\n Thanks to J.K. Rowling, eleventh birthdays are no longer a celebration, but rather a day to mourn the dreams that are lost. It was the day I went to bed, hugging my copy of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\\'s Stone, facing the heart breaking truth: you\\'re a muggle, Ashleigh., This book has to be my favourite of the series (though I haven\\'t read the seventh yet). \\n You can tell the difference in Harry from the fifth book and how he has grown up and been effected by the people he has lost. \\n I don\\'t want to give too much away, so I wont, but I believe that Harry is now standing on his own feet and realises what he has to do... \\n From the last book we get a glimpse of the prophecy, and now we see how he handles it all. \\n Though he has trouble trusting people he tries very hard in this book. \\n I think if you have got as far as the fifth book their is know doubt that you will be reading the sixth. \\n But just for reassurance purposes, this book was fantastic., Pretty Good Book, JK Rowling: Your Books Rock, And Are Not Bad At All!, full of suspense I loved it., Unimaginable kids book for adults! When was the last time i didn\\'t sleep to finish a super thick good book? Absorbing, alluring, amazing, bewildering, bewitching, captivating, charming, consuming, dazzling, engaging, engrossing, entertaining, enthralling, entrancing, fantasizing, fascinating, fulfilling, gratifying, gripping, hypnotizing, interesting, infatuating, intriguing, magnetizing, mesmerizing, shocking, spellbinding, startling, stimulating, stunning, surprising, thrilling ... Authentic!, Banyak romance di buku ini, tapi saya nikmatin kok karena romance-nya terjadi antara dua orang tokoh yang emang saya suka sebagai pasangan, hehe, Ron dan Hermione. Saya seneng baca buku ini karena momen mereka, selain tentunya klimaks akhir juga kisah masa lalu Voldemort. Buku ini bukan buku Harry Potter favorit saya, tapi saya sukaaaaa banget sama bab-bab terakhir. Lightning-Struck Tower. Flight of the Prince. The Cave. Pokoknya bagian klimaks. Dan yang jelas, banyak momen yang bikin saya terharu, simpati, kasihan, dll, lumayan banyak kasih bertebaran di volume ini. Karakter-karakternya berkembang, semuanya tiga dimensi. I like it., oh ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, TEARS EVERYWHERE, every one know:) \\n its about harry who studied in hagvartez and very exciting event happend to him, As the war rages on, things keep happening. I still preferred the less darker settings of the previous books, but this was a solid read. Harry potter is no longer the innocent geeky child. \\n Which I liked a lot... but I guess characters grow. I kinda wish the series had taken a different turn. More exploration of mechanics within the school, classes, etc, but that\\'s life., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Every time I read this book I fall in love with it even more. I understand that they needed to kill off Dumbledor to motivate harry to go out on his own in the next book but still sad. \\n Snape is written so evil that it doesn\\'t come as a surprise when he kills Dumbledor. \\n Good read :), ** spoiler alert ** \\n FUCK YOU SNAPE, 5 stars is not enough., I CRIED SO MUCH WHEN DUMBLEDORE DIED AND AT HIS FUNERAL, TOO!!!!!!!!!! :(, Not one of my favorite Harry Potter books but still gets five stars!, Harry Potter is just great fun for anyone at any age., Dumbledore died which was very expected lately...He was put into a fake horcrux but its still a good book., Loved this book (of course). But I didn\\'t find it as entertaining as the others. It was still a great read, very entertaining and very enjoyable. And even though it wasn\\'t the most exciting I still wanted to keep reading., In my opinion, the worst of the seven books in the HP series. \\n It lacked complexity of some of the previous books and was pretty focused on the good versus evil theme. Rowling probably wanted to set the stage for the big finale, making this book utterly painful to read in process. Most of the anticipated characters weren\\'t even in it and Harry was most annoying character in the books. \\n Overall, I have to say that it did have its peaks and for that I\\'ll give it a solid rating of three stars., Siempre es doloroso ver morir a los que amamos. \\n En este libro se relata una de las muertes que mas he llorado en Harry Potter., I confirmed once more this is my favourite hp book, ** spoiler alert ** \\n Haha. I was sad enough to find it scary (and sad, obviously, I mean why did Dumbledore have to die?!), I ofcourse started getting into Harry Potter because I have children so for years now I have enjoyed the movies and books. I thought this book was great and honestly it was so much better then the movie. I love tmore near he beginning where Dumbledor goes to Harry\\'s house it\\'s just so funny. I wish they put that in the movie. I also like how dumbldore dies in the book better then the movie. Well my opinion I love all the characters and I love all the Harry Potter Books and the read is much better then the movie. This movie especially., Definitely one of the best Harry Potters. It was a true emotional rollercoaster., It is really hard to stop reading the Harry Potter saga when you start. This book Is the beginning of the end, where Harry starts to realize his connection with Lord Voldemort. In addition, it shows how the children in the first books become young adults., I read these to my parents. We just finished it this one and we\\'re going to work on number 7 soon., Best Harry Potter book. Action-packed, lots happens and none of it drags or plods unnecessarily. So many questions... what\\'s the deal with Snape?, I\\'ve read it in my last vacation. Read this book, or other series, always more interesting than watching the movies. \\n The movie always shorter than the book. Many parts of the story, that I can fine in the book,I can\\'t find in the movie. \\n So, I can say that, book is more complete than the movie. Le\\'s read., Let me tell you, this book (like other harry potter books ) is amazing., This one is about Harry finding the old potion journal of the half blood prince who is the best student. (Who it turns out to be is a surprise!) It was a really enjoyable book full of twists and turns and unexpected outcomes., great book loved it, Really great! That is all., Aww, this one is so sad, but I loved it!, This is the worst one., Snape the TRAITOR!!!, Sectumsempra! A deadly spell, found by Harry in the potions book provided by Professor Slughorn, invented by Snape and used on his favorite boy,Draco Malfor from Slytherin, A very good book with all the occlumelency lessons, Dumbuldore\\'s death-which was very sad for me. The exciting twists of event made this book my second favorite book in this series!, The sixth book in the Harry Potter series is another gem of complex storytelling. It\\'s increible to see the work that J. K. Rowling put into her books to make one solid, comprehensive narrative that flows right from book I of the series. Obviously the dramatic ending is a huge talking point of this book, and it sets up the events of The Deathly Hallows well. \\n If you haven\\'t read this, get on it. You won\\'t regret it!, Given that the series is only one book away from completion, I was hoping that this one would be a massive improvement over some of the other books. \\n Unfortunately, I was disappointed. \\n The biggest problems I had with the book were all plot-related. One of which was that there seemed to be several smaller plots running alongside each other but no overlying major plot other than the usual \"Harry leaves the Dursleys early and spends the rest of the summer at the Burrow, Harry arrives at Hogswarts while being bullied or mocked by Draco on the train, Harry goes through the school year with his classes, and then everything culminates into the big event at the end.\" I\\'ll discuss some of the individual smaller plots. \\n One of the sub-plots is Harry and Dumbledore, using memories taken from other people, piecing together the past of Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort. The biggest problem is that there are huge gaps in time between the instances where the two look at the memories and Dumbledore spends most of the book away, tracking down the memories. This means that it doesn\\'t flow smoothly, and I wish we had more insight into what Dumbledore was actually doing and what led him to go from person A to person B to person C for information, which would feel more like piecing together pieces of a puzzle and which would have been far more interesting. This sub-plot concludes with the visit to the cave (which, again, what was Dumbledore thinking to take Harry there to find a horocrux?), which was too Tolkien-esque for my taste and was also a let-down when you discover that the horocrux isn\\'t even there. \\n Another sub-plot is Harry being suspicious that Draco is working for Voldemort, and so he spends part of the school year trying to figure it out. This is tied in to the strange Katie Bell incident and to the accidental poisoning of Ron. To make matters worse, while Harry has little real evidence that Draco is behind it and yet proves to be correct, Rowling didn\\'t drop any real hints about what is going on. The bartender in Hogsmeade is proven to be under control by the Death Eaters, but there was no hints that this was going on and that she is connected to both of the incidents. \\n A third sub-plot is Harry using the potions textbook that was used by the mysterious \"Half-Blood Prince.\" The prince, who is clearly a genius when it comes to potions, writes down how they really are supposed to go (which begs the question, how can anyone pass potions class if the textbook is essentially wrong in the first place?), and even creates a few spells and potions of his own. Harry relies on the judgement of the prince and even uses some of the spells accidentally against other people, one spell is actually dark magic. And yet, we are given no real hints about the identity of the prince, other than Harry\\'s stubborn belief that it is a male. Then, suddenly, at the end of the story, you learn the Half-Blood Prince is none other than Harry\\'s hated teacher Snape. Again, there were no real hints dropped about Snape being the individual, and the whole \"mother\\'s last name is Prince\" seemed like a let-down. Not to mention that this plot is rather small, which makes me wonder why the book title was even chosen in the first place. \\n A fourth sub-plot is the teenage romances and love triangles throughout the book. You have Hermione liking Ron, who is dating Lavender, and then you have Harry liking Ginny, who is known for her numerous boyfriends. So having Harry and Ginny, who\\'ve previously not shown much attraction to each other (not counting Ginny\\'s girlish crush on Harry in the early books), hook up was rather abrupt and felt like it was thrown in for good measure. The same issue happens later between Lupin and Tonks. \\n Another plot-related problem was the revelation of the horocruxes. Given what has previously been revealed in the other books, it only shakily fits in, and again it is very Tolkien-esque (dark lord binds his soul or essence to an object(s) which prevent him from being fully destroyed). To me, it feels like Rowling didn\\'t plan ahead when she started writing the series or, if she did, it doesn\\'t flow very well or have a build-up in the other books. \\n A final problem is character-related, but most of it has been happening in the rest of the series. In this book, Dumbledore is murdered, and the last chapter is of his funeral. For the entire series, the characters have been praising Dumbledore to the heights for his greatness and his goodness. My biggest problem is that I haven\\'t seen any true evidence of this. Dumbledore has always been in the background and always, at the end, is aware/ finds out what is truly going on and explains things to Harry, but nothing that I\\'ve read indicates that Dumbledore is the amazing individual that he is painted as. I do wish that Rowling had developed him more because there was plenty she could have done with him but didn\\'t. That being said, his funeral chapter did make me sad, but I wish that I had more reasons to feel sad about his death other than the word of the characters. \\n That being sad, there were some good parts of the books. I definitely could not put it down, and it kept me engrossed. And I liked seeing the more vulnerable, afraid side of Draco, who has been constantly portrayed as a mindless bully who just snickers at people because he can. \\n I really wanted to like this book, but the plot really prevented this from happening. I hope that the last book is better., I love the way J.K. protrays Snape. He\\'s one of my favorite characters-besides Harry, that is., LOVE IS IN THE AIR.From Hermione, Ron and me for the book. Love it, one of my faves. 10/10, I\\'ve seen all of the movies, but this was the first Harry Potter book I\\'ve read (to my teen so he can fall asleep). Of course, it had much more detail and explanation than the movie. It was interesting to see what happened past the final movie scene and to see how certain scenes were completely different. Also, it goes into much more depth about Valdemort\\'s past (as seen through pensieve memories). Rowling\\'s writing feels thorough, in its description and handling of feelings, and that\\'s probably why her books are so popular. The characters are like old friends, and the plot makes sense. Well, we\\'re hooked now. I just wish we hadn\\'t started in the middle of the series. Now, my son wants to continue with the last book., Amazing!!! One of my favorite Harry Potter books of the 7!, This book is awesome! It is definitely my favorite out of all the harry potter books. This book is a very fast read, and is action packed with excitement! I would recommend almost anyone this book! J.K. Rowling always keeps the reading exciting., I like the story of the 2nd to the last installment of Harry Potter series. But somehow, I am sad that the Harry Potter fever will eventually coming in its way of fading or ending. It was a very mixed emotions story., The book in which the my thoughts of whether or not dumbledore is a secret dark lord become an almost certainty., *reread, everything is amazing.!, When you start this book it\\'s like taking a deep breath and pluging into the depths of dark waters. There are so many new important plot points being thrown at you at one time, it\\'s easy to sometimes feel like you are drowning in them. Everything is very important to the story and the reader; I just wish I could have been spaced out in the series a little more rather than pushed all into one book. It consumes most of the story leaving the book with a much different feel, to me, than the others., So good and so sad. As usual, J.K. Rowling makes you feel as if you\\'re inside Hogwarts yourself!, I love this book. Maybe I\\'m too late to read every Harry Potter, but I absolutely won\\'t regret to read this masterpiece by JK. Rowling :D, Awesome, Fans of the first five books won\\'t be disappointed with the sixth offering, which sets things in motion that cannot be undone. A very fun read., This book had me hooked, couldn\\'t put it down. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that it just focused on Harry and Dumbledore, who I love both. I just needed more characters to get me that extra hooked, but all in all I loved it!!!, Ada ke ahli sihir yang ada half-blood? Kacukan? Atau apa yang dipanggil \\'mud blood\\'? Siri yang paling best saya rasa. (tapi belum baca siri ke-7 lagi, dengar kata siri 7 paling best). Siri yang paling sedih bagi saya, kerana Harry kehilangan Profesor Dumbledor kesayangannya dalam satu pertempuran. Paling sedih, sebab Harry baru saja kehilangan bapa angkatnya (Sirius Black) dalam siri sebelum ini., Above all, this is the best books of the series. I know is sad enough to lose someone we follow \"a little\" (trying not to spoiler) and other huge facts, this was the one I wasn\\'t tired to read. I was wondering what is my favorite of the series, and finally I got my one. Too many facts to understand and so much exciting things more than follow Harry\\'s school schedule -- I like it, but in fact, in other books was too much in some parts. \\n As I said, the best of J.K. Rowling and a great book to read and enjoy., this was my least favorite of all the books. i thought it was painfully slow right up until the very end and then BAM...everything happens but nothing is resolved., Era il mio film preferito...e anche il mio preferito della saga cartacea fino ad ora....adesso aspettero per comprarmi il seguito eheh, Oh Professor Dumbledore.. we miss uuuuuuu..., See Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone for my review of all seven books., In this one, Harry starts a new relationship with Ginny Weasly, Ron\\'s younger sister. Harry also starts taking private lessons from Dumbldor, the worlds most powerful wizard. In these classes, Harry learns more about his most hated enemy, Lord Voldemort., I cannot even explain my feelings on this series, how I have gone 15 years without feeling the emotions I feel when reading these books I don\\'t know. I cried, I laughed and I cried and laughed again. All I can say is that I love Harry Potter and even though I know reading Deathly Hallows will break me, it will also be amazing. 5/5 as always, ** spoiler alert ** \\n nooooooooooo dumbledore, What can I say? A Harry Potter book named after my favorite Harry Potter character is of course going to satisfy my appetite., i had intended to finish this book before deathly hallows came out, but i am still not finished. i am just reading it slowly and trying to fend off spoilers on this book and deathly hallows., The best one in the series. Hands down., this was the first book I read and finished..!!... :D, A tragedy struck me when Dumbledore died and I got to see the snake in snape. I was so psyced to know the rest of the story as fast as I can that I watched the movie Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow part 1 and 2 the same day I finished this book., A great follow-on in the series, Yes., OMG! plus, WTF Snape!!! I\\'m so confused but can\\'t wait to read the Deathly Hallows!!!!, one of my fave out of 7 books, A surprising ending that just makes want to read the next book asap., You should read this book., this one was good...., okay i love tis book but dumbledore dyong was tragic jk rowling is the best twilight aint got nothing on harry potter ama go see deathly hallows soon pt 1, This book was awesome! It so far is my favorite harry potter book. There were so many twists and turns; it had me on the edge of my seat with every chapter. This book, however, also made me sad and nostalgic., Dumbledore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, One acronym sums up the book quite nicely: \\'wtf\\'. Random moments, random relationships sprouting from no-where and characters are off and act like teenagers on drugs., Nulla da commentare... harry potter e harry potter :-), el que emnos em gusta de todos, se hace pesado y horrible, JK Rowling\\'s books always amazed me..., It is Harry\\'s 6th year at Hogwarts and J.k. rowling makes it another breattaking journey., kekuatan cinta sejati dari seorang yang tidak dihiraukan menjadikan aku memberi rating 5 bintang. Juru kunci cerita ini adalah terletak pada seorang idealis yg tidak ingin di sebut pengecut yaitu Prof. Severus Snape. dan jelas keberaniannya telah menjadikan buku ini menjadi semanis madu., Getting a little too dark, Being my least favorite book in the series so far, Half-Blood Prince was by far the slowest book in the series. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel just like every other harry potter book. Just because it\\'s labeled as my least favorite doesn\\'t mean I didn\\'t absolutely adore it. The last 250 pages were the some of the most riveting of the series and revealed so much of what I was missing within the first several hundred pages of the novel., I learned that if you find a horcruz, don\\'t touch it., This Book was awesome.. I loved every Bit of it I think the movie was a bit of a disappointment to the Book. I loved how Ron and Hermione are finally starting to realize there feeling or each other and same with Harry and Ginny., ** spoiler alert ** \\n This was a compelling book and i enjoyed it very much the sequence of events were good the way the author described the inferi in details were even amazing. All in all this book was great with some slight faults in my point of view. The death of Albus Dumbledore I think was a bad way to end in my opinion i think he should have been killed fightinhg rather than being disarmed and killed with a stunning spell. \\n I didnt enjoy the way she stretched out the relationship of Ron and Lavender. I didnt enjoy the short relationship between Harry and Ginny which should have been extended further into the book not with them breaking up but with them hiding the fact that they still go together. In the end this was a great and i give it a 4 1/2 star rating. Until my next review this is Carlos L. C. logging off., Getting deeper into Voldemort, excellent relationship stuff and fab final chapters with Dumbldore and Harry\\'s quest and coming back into a devastating invasion of Hogwarts. Getting so much more serious and dark now but still keeping the relationships bubbling and the flashes of character humour... just the way I like it, see sorcerers stone review, The one where Ron notices girls basically, In \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,\" Harry gets more confused as ever when strange things start happening within the castle. He knows Malfoy is up to something, but he cant seem to find anything that he can use as proof! Hes constantly burdened by \"the Slug Club,\" being the new Quittich Captian,sorting out his feelings towards Ginny, and trying to keep Ron and Hermione from killing each other! \\n I enjoyed the relationship between Dumbledore and Harry especially in this book because their relationship grows so much stronger and you can see Harry slowly starting to understand what the past and future means, with Dumbledore by his side the whole way. \\n I recomment this book to everyone that can read because it contains so many wonderful parts and has so many great stories to tell, I dont want anybody to miss out!, I think Harry is obsessed over what Malfoy is doing. I also think that Harry is now proud that he got the memory from Slughorn. I wonder if Harry\\'s scared or not., awesome, ** spoiler alert ** \\n So if Snape killed Dumbledore then why is still considered a good guy? Like....oooooh my gooooodddd stop your ****ing lyinnnnnnnnn, Ever more emotional and even darker than any book thus far, this book had me both in floods and hysterics. The stark contrasts between the highs and lows of this book are second to none and I was nothing short of an emotional wreck by the end. And it\\'s amazing. The detail and the thought that goes into these storylines is incredible and I\\'d strongly recommend you read it., I absolutely love this series! I always have since I was like 8 years old, but by the time this one came out I had switched from Order to Death Eater. Tom Riddle (jr.) is totally amazingly awesomely HOTT! Yes, I am sixteen. Total Fan-girl age., so much adventure mixed with a bit of romance LOVED IT, Warning!! This is a spoiler don\\'t read it if you haven\\'t read the book. \\n First of all I am so sad, J.k why did you have to kill my favorite character? I don\\'t believe that Dumbledore is really dead. I have a feeling that he will surely resurface at some point. Why did you have to make him the pillar of everything only to turn around kill him? \\n The half blood prince is so two faced, whom is he really supporting? Why is he such a watermelon? Though he is a good connection between the two sides, he is my least favorite, he should have been the one to die in Dumbledore\\'s place. I am yet to come to terms with this unexpected turn of events., By far this one was the most painful., So...I\\'m 22 years old, and I just finished reading this book for the first time. Yes, I said the first time. Yes, I watched all of the movies before reading the entire series. YES, go ahead and judge me, you foolish purists and elitists! But when I tried reading the books with my Dad when they were each coming out when I was younger, I had more interest in using my imagination to play outside than sit still long enough to read books, especially big books like this. And, to be honest, after all the movies were out, I had told my parents that I had not desire to read the books. I had seen the movies, I had hundreds of trading cards, games, and other memorabilia that I used to find it pointless for me to read the books. But shortly before I finished my second year of college, I was home for Easter weekend and desperate to find a book in my house that I hadn\\'t read yet (because my opinion of reading big books had changed, obviously). Easter Sunday, my Dad walked into the living room and found me curled up on the couch with my nose deep in \"Sorcerer\\'s Stone\". All he did was take one look at me, then walk out of the living room while whispering, \"Told ya.\" I haven\\'t regretted reading this series since then. I purposely take my own time reading certain books so I can enjoy them longer, which started out being the case with this book, since I started it during my winter holiday break in December of last year. By the time I got to the chapter, \"A Very Frosty Christmas,\" I decided to take a break and read other things for a while. I wasn\\'t fully captivated yet. But by Wednesday of this past week, I decided I wanted to get back to this one and find out why it\\'s such a hit. Now I see why. I especially love the back story of young Tom Riddle, and I\\'m staring to see why, even as the main villain, he\\'s still liked by Harry Potter fans (at least more than Umbridge). His handsome description, his behavior, his lineage...everything about him makes him so fascinating. This book has been my favorite of the series so far! I\\'m excited to get started with #7!, I don\\'t like this book at all. For the new jinxes coming from the book of \"the half-blood prince\" are great, cruelly but great! Draco Malfoy finally have more participation than just saying stupid insults to Hermione, that was good too but at the end the book don\\'t fulfill my expectations. Maybe I don\\'t like this book because my heart was broken again with Dumbledore\\'s death, that was a big punch in my heart not most bigger than the Sirius\\'s death but I feel terrible and I cried (and still crying) for his death., As the series progresses the books get darker and more enjoyable even for adults:-), Imagination is all you need to enjoy this book, Excelente lectura. Como siempre, JKRowling nos maravilla con las aventuras de los mejores personajes., just amazing., An amazing prequel to the epic finale., A superb book., Need next book, I LOVE IT, \\'\\'To know the future, you must return to the past.\\'\\' \\n _ We find out so mush about Tom Riddle, before he become lord Voldmort and I loved getting those glimpses into his life from before his birth, to him as a child, to his path into adulthood growing darker and darker. \\n _ Also, I loved Harry and Ginny, Fleur and Mrs. Weasly and the half blood princes book., Well well when the fifth edition came out it turned out to be dud!! But in this book again Ms.J.K.Rowling works up her magic.It is a good book and is written keeping the main readers in mind as young adults.read it and I\\'m sure you will like it and a precaution to the first time potter readers you might not be able to keep track of the plot and how the story is proceeding., So good. \\n Voldemort\\'s back story was very intresting and thank lord the ending gave some sort of hope!, Always., Great, great book! \\n it is on my top three. \\n Harry is almostb a grown up and deals with all kinds of problems a teen would have...including saving the world from an evil wizard! xD, sedih bgt waktu dumbledore meninggal. endingnya cm buat aku berpikir usaha yg sia2 dengan pengorbanan yang sangat besar, I\\'ve enjoyed all of the Harry Potter books and I\\'m not ashamed to admit it - even though I was way older than the target audience was supposed to be. As he got older the books got darker - brilliant!!, i am not read this book yet., AWESOME BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \\n This is my favorite book ever. I love it! I cried the first time because Dumbledore died. I was so mad. Anyway it\\'s a really good book!, Another year and another Hogwarts adventure. Not the strongest or most loved of the books (my least liked of the series), but probably one of the most influential of the overall story. Think of it as the middle movie in a trilogy, just there to eat up time, dispenses some mildly interesting information, but has that one impactful event the completely defines it (if you read it before then you know what that event was). For me that\\'s all this book ends up being, and I\\'d be just as happy having read the Spark Notes/Cliff Notes version of this book. Still worth reading if your a fan of the series so read away. But don\\'t get your hopes up that the next book will make up for this one. Spoiler! It won\\'t..., RATING : Infinite stars \\n I read this book quite a long time ago, and yet it\\'s still one of my favourite. It\\'s simply enchanting, with twists and turns and a shocking cliff hanger. The character development is wonderful. The romance is not (but we\\'ll excuse that because JK Rowling is not a romance writer in the slightest). It was all generally mystical, wonderful and of course, magical., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I thought this book had a very dramatic and dark ending that completely changed Harry. The fact that the doesn\\'t want to return to Hogwarts to continue hunting the Horcruxes is a little disappointing, because he will never get a full education, but also exciting because it means he will continue Dumbledore\\'s work., Read!, Great! A perfect ending for everlasting writing. :), The second book I read in the HP series -yeah, I know, a little bit topsy turfy - but I was staying in s dingy flat in Newcastle, UK, and it was left behind by the previous occupant. And by now I had bought the final book. Guess which one I read next?, reread it still good as icr, I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever recover, It\\'s sad but great!, This was my second favorite book in the whole series (The Deathly Hallows was the best). It was very well written and it took me only a few days to finish because I did not want to put it down. The 6th installment in the Harry Potter series, but it certainly comes close to best., One of the Best from whole series, Not bad a book. The ending(& Dumbledore\\'s death) was interesting., Enchanting as always., Still in shock. I\\'m Sad, REALLY sad., I deeply regret that I had watched the movie itself before I had read the book. However, it didn\\'t stop me from enjoying my reading experience and concluding that the book is still better than the movie. As I was reading the book, I feel pity on Draco. Not because he was forced to do something for a threat but because he was not happy on doing it so. Seeing him cry on the boy\\'s bathroom seems out of character. However, despite his rude character, I still think he would make a good sidekick. What do you think? Maybe it\\'s a bit crazy to say this but I think Harry missed and half-enjoyed Malfoy\\'s taunts. \\n I guess it\\'s safe to say that J.K. Rowling really knows about teenage romance, even though she is a retired teenager. And I\\'m glad she did not overdo it or should I say made a chapter about it. But of course this drama is nothing compared on Harry\\'s experienced on losing all who had protected him. It must be sad being an orphan. Contrary to the lament, I am now eager to read the 7th and final book for Harry is now totally committed on killing Voldemort. Likewise, I expect a hardcore training on Harry for the epic battle and not the typical sheer dumb luck. \\n PS: Remember for enemies: Sectumsempra!, i thought this book is one of JK Rowling\\'s best books.it was so touched just to know harry lost dumbledore, a man who is very kind with him. And, harry lost what he called family.after mom dad, sirius and then dumbledore.it is a great books to read, and i enjoyed read it!, For a boy that grew up as overlooked and unloved there is nothing better than knowing your needed by those who you care about. Harry\\'s adventures show that he takes the new responsibilities very serious. Kids learn a lot about being responsible, parents learn a lot about letting them!, Voldemort: The History..., This book is just too much. Too much love, too much loss, to much magic, too much pain... J.K. Rowling is indeed one of the best there is in the business. I\\'m in awe with this story and this world. No words can describe the thrilling adventure it is going into Hogwarts every single time. I have nothing left to say right now., This book is very linked to the first one. It really builds on the last one, but this doesn\\'t stand alone like the 5th one. \\n It\\'s still amazing and totally awesome though. \\n Loved it!, harry potter just lost his best source of comfort. the wizarding community is in tragic mourn now that one of the greatest wizards in their world has already departed. no more brilliant thoughts coming from Professor Albus Dombledore. \\n i praised Severus Snape for a very wonderful job, he carries the most troubling and difficult task in his bold shoulders. \\n and to Minerva McGonagall, good luck!, It was very slow but enjoyable. I like the love lives of the characters., My FAVORITE book in the series!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n \"Dumbledore is dead, gone...\" \\n NOT CRYING MY EYES OUT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, Just like the last time, I\\'m a bit sad that the journey is coming closer to its final destination. This is the darkest and most detailed book in the Harry Potter series yet. Voldemort\\'s role in the stories gets bigger by the book, he gets more depth because we learn about his backstory. That was maybe my favorite part of this book. And it\\'s good that Rowling waited this long to reveal more about Voldemort. We get to know and love Harry, Hermione and Ron more and more and we become a part of their world. This book was fast paced and a real page turner. What I thought was great about the sixth book is that Rowling created the perfect cliff-hanger. A good mystery creates a load of questions. This is a great set-up for the final installment. And we come closer to the enchating ending., My favourite of the Harry Potter series!, Aku suka sekali, sangat diluar dugaan, apalagi mengenai salah satu tokoh utama yang mati. \\n yang ini adalah seri yang paling mendebarkan yang pernah kubaca, kecuali yang kelima masih lebih mendebarkan, aku tidak membaca yang kelima, terlalu tebal., Ripped my heart out, Back to a more intriguing story than #5 in the series. I enjoyed this one!, cuando termine el libro me di cuenta de lo rapido que lo habia leido y lo cerca que estaba el final de la historia. \\n este es sin duda alguna el libro, que junto a las reliquias de la muerte comparten el puesto de mi libro favorito de la saga, I think that so much important things happened in this book to understand the whole magical world. So good and delicious to read! The audiobook helps a lot too, good quality!, kind of drawn out, Originally read 2005. Reread many times since., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I thought I was sad when Cedric and Sirius died! AND I KNEW SNAPE COULD NEVER BE TRUSTED WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY, It has been quite a while since I last read this (maybe 2 years or longer?). And I\\'m quite shocked about how much I forgot what happened! It was amazing to re-read this and dive into the HP world again, not knowing every single detail about the story. Almost like I read it for the first time. \\n Book Ginny might be my favourite, next to Hermione and Draco (poor poor Draco)! Though I wished the Weasley twins had a bigger part in this one, I kinda miss their chaos., Grief is the star of this book. Grief over things that could have been, things that should have been, things that come to be. Harry has grown up, in a way he never wanted or expected, but he stands tall and moves forward with the hand he has been dealt. He is man now, though he is only 16. He has seen death, experienced torture, suffered terrible losses. He is finally stripped of his last lifeline, and decides to face his fate regardless of what that may mean for him., ** spoiler alert ** \\n I am so heartbroken over the death of dumbledore even though I was told beforedY\\'\" Yet, i loved the part when they talked about Voldemort past!, I really enjoyed this book, it was amazing knew about Voldemort\\'s past but it was also sad the end of the book ;__;, Appeared less than my expectations. Too much pressure on the story. Dark., Not my favourite HP book, but still, it\\'s Harry Potter!! I loved getting the backstory of Tom Riddle becoming Voldemort and it was also nice to read the occasional relationship developments within the characters between those moments. The ending is a lot darker than the previous books, but that\\'s when you know that the whole Harry Potter - Voldemort feud is the real deal. This is the beginning of the epic battle!, Absolutely marvelous. More and more comes to light as Harry progresses in the year. I loved reading this., I have to say that this is my favorite book in the series. There\\'s always something going on, which keeps you reading. I\\'ve retread the book many times. And it\\'s hard to put down., good book, It has been fantastic... I lost three nights\\' sleep to read it...!, 1000000 stars really., it is sooo cool read it if you are into harry potter., Nothing to say, Rowling familiar humorous style but boring a little bit comparing to other episodes. That\\'s only my point., Reread it for a thousand times but still crying at the death scene. For long I have admired Albus Dumbledore just as Harry has. His death was a terrible shock for me., If you haven\\'t read Harry Potter/this book what the hell are you doing with your life? GO READ IT NOW, yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssssssssssss!!!! \\n #lovethisone \\n #howdoyoureviewaseriesthisperfect, Fabulous. Compelling and beautifully written. Pure fantasy with a twist of reality., Nothin, [image error] \\n This has got to be the best cliffhanger ever. There is such power in this book. It is my favorite in the series for one very important reason: since book one, Severus Snape has been my favorite character and this is his book, albeit not his story yet. His power, his intelligence, his confusing range of emotions and allegiance, finally come to full attention. I argued with many a doubter about his motives, and yet in my wildest imagination, I could not have justified him as well as Rowling does is book 7. \\n Even knowing the ending beforehand, I still found myself wanting more in the inadequate moments between Harry and Dumbledore. The sense of longing was perfectly planted for our heightened frustration and sadness in the end. I figured it was going to happen anyway, but it still got me. Rowling pulls you into these characters\\' lives. You are at Hogwarts mourning, afraid, alone with the lot of them. Even the emotional conclusion of book 7 did not affect the same power of emotion in readers you find in book 6. But more than wishing for more time for Harry, I wanted (needed) to understand the anger and sadness in Snape\\'s verbal attack. That is the beauty of book 6 is the ambiguity of it. \\n Initially I was frustrated between the summarizing instead of detailed accounts Rowling uses in every other book, but it correlates perfectly with the ambiguity of the story. This one got people talking (all I wanted to do after reading it was discuss). It left room for interpretation. Most importantly it left us impossibly waiting for a series conclusion. I reread book 6 a week before the release of book 7 and my anticipation was so high even those few days of waiting were agony., Amazing book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, I read this book non-stop without putting it down until I finished!, For those who haven\\'t read the books, or seen the movie (that list must be down to about four by now), I will be careful not to give away any spoilers. \\n I will say, I was shocked, amazed and saddened by the final events in this book. Admittedly, it did not end the way I wanted. Still, the story was so well done, and I loved the background on Voldemort. J.K. Rowling is an amazing storyteller!, Feels so good to finally finish a book. This was way better then I remember. \\n UPDATE: 2nd reread \\n Five stars. DUH. Harry Potter will always (ha) have a special place in my heart. \\n Now if only the movies were as good...., Pros: \\n -Fantastic pacing \\n -Great character development \\n -Huge reveals about certain plot points/characters \\n -Amazing plot arcs \\n -Huge twists \\n Cons: \\n -Starts slow \\n -Some scenes with side characters tend to drag, This may have not been my favorite of the series, but I still respect and enjoy it., <3, Este libro es muy emocional, por que Harry esta lidiando con la muerte de su padrino, cuando creia que por fin seria un nino normal con familia se vuelve a ver solo y encuentra este libro que lo hace destacar y le quita problemas de encima, comienza a darle mucha satisfaccion y entiendes por que se aferra a el, es porque despues de tantas emociones negativas algo que le haga sentir algo positivo es digno de defenderlo.... Por otra parte Harry tambien esta entendiendo la conexion que existe entre el y voldemord, visita los puntos importantes del pasado de este para poder entender su personalidad, esto siempre a lado de dumbledore que desde el principio Harry lo ha tenido en un alto pedestal... Cuando tocan el tema de la muerte de dumbledore te llevan al limite de la histeria porque no puedes entender porque le ocurren tantas desgracias juntas a Harry y como lidia con ella, que hace con todo ese dolor., Weakest of the series next to Chamber of Secrets, imho., The end shocked me., Why does this timeless tale of wizardry need another five-star review? Because even though many millions of human beings agree that this series is perfection, nobody seems to understand why. Why has the book about a boy who finds out that he is a wizard and sent to a special school to learn about magic sold HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of copies? Why will this book still be read by children and adults alike centuries from now? \\n To understand what makes the whole series so fantastic, one must take several points into consideration, as there are just so many reasons for it to be so popular. However, I only have the energy to mention a few, as I am tired and have had a horrible day: \\n First of all, the series ages with the reader. I read the series as I believe it was intended to be read, my mum reading the first book out loud to me when I was about six. Even though I was perfectly capable of reading it myself, it became kind of our thing, her reading Harry Potter to me. at least until my brother was born. But that\\'s okay, because now my brother loves the books too. He was given the third book for his birthday the other day, and the look on his face was priceless. Anyway, my point is, children that age grow up, and Rowling seems to understand that so well. The first books are light and humoristic, compared to the intricate web of a plot that unfolds in the later ones. \\n Second of all, the books are funny. The sense of humour with which Rowling writes has me returning to Hogwarts again and again. It\\'s the sort of ageless comedy that can make you howl with laughter, coursing your parents to finally give in to curiosity and ask you what\\'s so funny. \\n Third of all, they are so well thought out, the plot twisted, delicate and unpredictable, yet understandable for all readers. It\\'s not just the incredible plot twists that leave you jaws wide open, it\\'s also the equally mind-blowing details, like the relevance of how Harry in his first quidditch match caught the snitch in his mouth. I remember how amazed I was when I first read the book that that tiny, seemingly irrelevant if hilarious detail should have such importance six books later. \\n Fourth of all (and this will be my final point, as I don\\'t want everyone to think I have nothing better do with my life. Also, I doubt anyone has actually bothered to read this entire review. So if you are reading this, THANK YOU. Really.) I will address the boundless imagination poured into the work of art that is Harry Potter. The names of the people, places and... other stuff are totally original and (in the people\\'s case) reflect the characters like a bloody mirror. Dumbledore sounds as quietly wise as Filch sounds cruel. I mean, Filch is totally the audio equivalent of a scowl. Some may argue that anyone could think up a story about a school that teaches magic. I think that that factor makes the books even better. Because Rowling has done what many previously thought impossible: taking an obvious, widely used concept and turning it into something nothing short of beautiful., This might have been one of my favorites of the series so far! I really enjoyed the relational aspect of the book, the back stories of some of the characters, and the ending had me covered in chills and tears. This book makes me unable to wait to start the last book of the series., It\\'s Harry Potter, what\\'s not to love. Not my favorite of the series, but probably the best finish, even though sad, of all the books, Loved Krecher!! WONT WONT WONT WONT WONT!!! Rowling did a good job of weaving this part of the story together. As in Order of The Phoenix we get a real sense of the politics of the wizarding world, as well as more of a sense of Albus Dumbledore being more than a Merlin type mentor figure and an actual manipulator of the course of Harry\\'s life since Vol... I mean \\'He who must not be named\\' tried to kill him as a baby., Speechless., Rowling shows her inventiveness yet again with the creation of Slughorn. We all know someone like him, right, without realizing it until she puts it down on paper. I loved, too, the excursions into Dumbledore\\'s memory and how the characters all continue to grow., hmmsama kaya HP yg laen bagus..tp kok mesti pake maati siy..bikin sedih ajah.., schade, dass bei all dem Merchandising, kreischenden 12-jahrigen und oberflachlichen Filmen oft ubersehen wird, dass es sich um ein sehr intelligentes, kreatives und sensibles Buch mit toll entwickelten Personlichkeiten und gar nicht so einfachen Zusammenhangen handelt. Das Schone an den Filmen dagegen sind die schottischen Akzente mancher Schauspieler, weswegen ich mir fur\\'s Wochenende noch ein Kino suchen werde, wo der neue auf englisch lauft..., Love., This has to be the craziest book out of the whole Harry Potter series., OK, now we\\'re going down hill. I expected a lot from this book and it let me down just a little. Parts of it were excellent, but overall it doesn\\'t compare it Book 4., This one of the Potter books (more so than the others) I felt had a \"bazillion\" unanswered questions, one piled on top of the other, for a large part of the book. I felt like I was forgetting things I was waiting to learn the answer to because it was such a tangled web. BUT, that said, I think it was a very good book. And it is, after all, the middle of the story, so ..., Simply one of the most enjoyable books and series I\\'ve ever read. Pure entertainment, pure fun. As witty and well-written as it gets., Probably the worst in the entire series ON REPEATED READS. Initially at the age of 17 I was ecstatic and I drank the juice however 6 years later this book does not hold up at all. It all seems very phoned in example the horcrux device seems incredibly phoned in and does not hold up when you read other books as it seems coincidental. Also the length to call this book filler is an understatement and it is the worst kind of filler because all the characters are utterly unlikable and so enthralled by their own means constantly it is just tedious. Dumbledore obviously was doomed to die in a very star wars esque scene in which he welcomed death like obi wan. All in all the book ultimately goes from ohhhh interesting chapters 1 - 5 into cliche central. \\n The romances are annoying and delude the world which is the worst thing. Worst of all Rowling\\'s bad writing blossoms in this book as it is incredibly linear and ok described but her writing does not really show much growth it just stays at that level which is unfortunate. To me the quality Harry Potter ended at Book 4; Goblet of Fire and became a phoned in series because hell it made gazillions of money but it\\'s quality and content was sacrificed as a penalty in which cliches for example horcruxes; pretty much like the rings of power they had a curse and had a spirit inside, though it could be considered somewhat original it had no gravity because it was so late in the series uf around book 3 it was brought up or book 4 it would of been perfect., my favorite of the harry potter series. much better than the movie, although it did live up to it\\'s expectations., Loved it. So much more detail than the movie. Great story., Harry Potter is part of my childhood. What did you think then? <3, asa teu rame, I don\\'t want to give anything away, but this was a really good one., i really need to read this, everyone i knowthinks iv read it, and when i tell them i didnt they are surprised cuz i read evey songle fantasy bookthere is, so they say i am missing out on alot, so i need to read it soon, ive seen a few of the movies though, and they are very good, :) :) :), I hate how much this book made me feel. That sounds ridiculous, but I have a lot of emotions to process., I don\\'t know how many times I\\'ve read this serie but rediscovering the horcruxes mystery was a pleasure ! Next time, I\\'ll read it in English., Olaylarin iyice karistigi ve kizistigi kitapta Harry\\'nin psikolojisi ve ogrendigi her yeni sey adina art arda yasadigim soklar ve sonunda kitabi sika sika agladigimi hatirlamam... Sanirim kitap ve insan arasindaki iliskiyi bu sekilde tanimlayabilirdim. Mukemmel., Can it be more real?, Really amazing series over all! Once you start one, you have to read all the others!, Such a sad ending. My son had watched the movie before we listened to the book together, and he had already told me what happened. It was still sad to listen to the ending., Too sad. So sad. Too sudden., Awsem book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince written by J.K. Rowling is the sixth book in the Harry Potter series. In this book Harry meets a suspicious Half-blood Prince. This Prince helps Harry through all of his potion works and defense against the dark arts classes. Voldemort is gaining power like never before and the only way to stop this is by destroying the horcuxes. It is only up to Harry,Ron and Hermione to do the job. In this book a very sad and dramatic event happens between Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. This book is definatly in my top ten and I recomend it to anyone., absolutely loved this one! so many plot twists, This is where Harry really begins his search to get rid of voldmort, he who must not be named. There are some twist and a death of character sniffle sniffle but you will have to read to find it who I wont give away any spoilers!!! Enjoy, I can\\'t breathe. Why must Dumbledore :((((, No me resigno a la muerte de Dumbledore (menos a la de Sirius). Odio a Draco. Quiero pegarle a Snape. Y Hermione es verdaderamente desesperante y envidiosa cuando alguien de sus amigos sobresale en inteligencia, aveces si merece ser llamada \\'sangre-sucia\\'. Me sigue encantando el humor de Ron. Tengo un crush con Tom Marvolo Riddle (su cabello negro y tez palida). Amo los horrocruxes., ketinggian yah ratingnya? tapi emang worthed ko.., impressive....., ** spoiler alert ** \\n Seriously seriously seriously? This book was so beautiful and so sad. Harry has completely grown up and the burden of what he has to do is crushing him. I\\'ve never been so excited and so scared to finish a series before..., Best book of the series. Love it., Rating - 5 \\n This. Book. Oh my god, if I wasn\\'t so fixed on The Goblet of Fire I might have said it was my favourite in the series. \\n This book was a bit shorter than the one before, so I wasn\\'t so worried that it would take so long to reach exciting parts!!! The whole way through reading was like a discovery - it rounded out so many things we\\'ve heard about Harry\\'s story thus far, ironing out any parts which I was especially confused by and also added in new details which added to the drama of the series as a whole. \\n Reading this for the first time was an absolute page turner. As I hadn\\'t read or watched the series (also being able to avoid spoilers for such a long time, pretty lucky!) I had no idea what I was walking into. While I know what happens now, I know I will still be as shocked and stunned as I was the first time I read it - so many tears at so many parts of the story. \\n I\\'m actually embarrassed that I gave up on the book before those years ago, because I never got to read this amazing book in turn. I know that I will pick this up again, and possibly enjoy it even more than the first. Who knows!! What I am sure of though, is that this is and will remain one of my favourite books, not in the series but of all books I have read as a whole., Ah, this was much more like it. After slogging through book 5, this book picked up the pace, cut out a lot of the fat, and focussed on the central plot of Harry, Voldemort, Dumbledore, and the big war between the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix. Bye, Cho Chang, you won\\'t be missed. And in this much more focussed book all of Rowling\\'s considerable strengths come to the fore: compelling characters, exciting plot, great use of dangling subplots that suddenly come back to the foreground. \\n I knew the big twist ending going in, but if anything the knowledge of the horrible events at the end only made the book more intense. By the time I finished I was all ready to dive into book 7 and see how it ends. I thought better of it, and I\\'m taking a Harry breather, but in comparison to how I felt when I finished book 5, now I\\'m actually excited., I believe this book has dried my tear bags. I really hope it did cause i can\\'t afford to cry anymore., ** spoiler alert ** \\n AMAZING. So sad Dumbledore died tho :(:(, I just reread the series for maybe the 20th time, and I\\'ll probably read them another 20 times., Finished mid July, a bit slow at the start but all in all a good book, heart melting, funny, fantastic, phenomenal , the best, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I rate this book at least seven out of five stars. It has everything - from friendship to tragedy to drama to action as Harry Potter and his friends Ron and Hermione approach adolescence. Harry discovers a life changing secret. The prisoner turns out to be an innocent man, who has served thirteen long years in Azkaban Prison, in the place of his old school mate - who betrayed Harry\\'s parents, Peter Pettigrew. When the Prisoner of Azkaban Sirius Black (not to be confused with Serious Black) turns up at Hogwarts, the truth is revealed. Harry discovers Sirius Black is his Godfather, just before Sirius escapes on the back of a supposedly dead Hippogriff named Buckbeak. \\n Reading this book was a magical experience., my favourite book in the whole series, This is my favourite of all Harry Potter Books!!! But I am sure all of you have read the series already! \\n If not, muggle, you should read it instantly!!, i think this might be my favorite book out of the entire series. you learn so much about the past, present, and future, it\\'s hard to stop reading! it\\'s an amazing book all in all., Loved it dearly! JK Rowling is a genius! Couldn\\'t wait for the next book., Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series. This book the action and intensity is amplified because one of the major character dies., Loved this book, so glad I\\'m reading the series., i just love this book u all have to read it, This is my favourite book in the series. It\\'s just pure brilliance., My 2nd favorite book of the series, i cried like a baby when Dumbledore died., RE-RE-RE-RE-READ, oh god, Believe it or not this was the first book in the series I read. I didn\\'t think much of the these books until I kept hearing really good things about them, plus the movies were raking in millions so I figured the books had to be worth a read. I wasn\\'t disappointed., EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK IS AMAZING! THE CHARACTERS, COUPLES, and STORYLINE!, I\\'m still crying. I\\'m not okay. Don\\'t talk to me. I hate everyone., Don\\'t forget tissues ,people. Tell me ,you didn\\'t cry reading this *crying face emoji* Oh My :\\'( . The 6th book of Harry Potter. I don\\'t want to finish this series, because it\\'s part of my childhood. It feels like I live here in Harry Potter book. dY~, ** spoiler alert ** \\n As the title of the book suggests, the half blood prince is an important theme of this book. This book is the 6th book of the series and also one before the last book. Sirius Black died in the order of the Phoenix and I wasn\\'t ready for the death of another favorite character. And this was certainly a character I didn\\'t expect to ever die in the series, since he is one of the most important guidances Harry has, and he owns Hogwarts after all! If you couldn\\'t guess by now, Professor Dumbeldore dies at the end of this book which was totally unexpected for me. That\\'s the reason why I enjoy J. K. Rowling\\'s books so much, you\\'ll never know what you\\'re going to get, and you can never be prepared because you\\'ll never know what surprises she\\'ll pull at you. With that being said, the plot took an abrupt transition, and the last 60 pages of the book were full of excitement and adrenaline, whereas 80% of the book was just ordinary events at Hogwarts which made me think not a single important event will happen in this book. Clearly, I was wrong, but this was an overall nice book and if you\\'re a Harry Potter fan, you should definitely read it!, Best book ever!!!!!!!!!, This is probably my favourite one of the saga. I read them all, not in the correct order at first, and I think this is the one for me. Even though it is like choosing who is your favourite son (I don\\'t have kids, but I guess it\\'s not an easy choice), It was the first time I actually cried and laughed at the same time while reading a book, good, This book is so good. I liked too much, the worst !!! ini seri harry potter yang paling buruk. feel so disappointed when i was read this book, it\\'s feel that i was read a cheap teenlit books!! bener2 seperti baca buku remaja yang kisahnya cuma percintaan gak jelas, serunya cuma di bagian akhir, sangat terlihat disini Jk Rowling memenuhi \\'keinginan\\' pembaca, imajinasi liar yang gw baca itu sangat terlihat di buku 1-4, buku 5 itu bagus karena masuk ke inti cerita yang mengupas misteri satu persatu.. tapi ini cuma ada kisah cinta, bagian seru di akhirrr.. jadipenasaran sama buku terakhirnya? mengecewakan atau tidak ya?, A very good book. You can\\'t even complain about the length of the book, much as it drives you crazy, becuase by this point, you have fallen in love with the book. Most books are a lot better than their movies, but the harry potter movies, as well done as they are, are not even in the same stratosphere. My hat\\'s off to Rowling. I wish more children\\'s lit was this well written., My favorite book of all Harry Potter, nast basta hp boken <3, A lot of \"digging\" in this one! So interesting I couldn\\'t put it down!!! Love these characters., I think I noticed some plot holes in this book now that I\\'ve read it for what I can only assume is the ninth time. \\n How did Montague apparate out of that vanishing cabinet into the toilet in Year 5? You can\\'t apparate in or out of Hogwarts school grounds as Hermione has constantly reminded us. It really bothered me this time around. \\n But I still give this book 5 stars. Why? I don\\'t know. Nostalgia\\'s sake? Bias? Stubborness to admit JKR might be capable of making mistakes? All of the above? Who knows? Point is, this book is still amongst those that I have re-read the most and unless there was a master at work (a master who maybe might be making mistakes, but a master nonetheless), I doubt I would\\'ve stayed with Harry this far., Loved it, it made me cry I love Dumbledore, Enjoyed as I thought I would, but Harry\\'s obsesion with Draco is kinda meh., I read this book when it came out and reread this year in preparation of book 7. I actually like it better than book 7, hated that one of the main characters dies. But that is true in all good epic stories ... the teacher dies to strengthen the student for the final battle., Great read!, ** spoiler alert ** \\n I was told before I began reading this book that it was the dullest of the series. Yes, there is a lot of background information that can get a bit tedious, but it\\'s helpful in understanding things to come. One thing that shocked me... I DID NOT expect Dumbledore to die in the second to last book. I knew it would happen eventually, but I expected it to be in The Deathly Hallows., qS@ hry bwtr Tl`t rwmnsy@ \\n wTl` snb hw lbTl lHqyqy fy lqS@, This one is my second fav, Even though this will be about the 20th time I\\'ve read this book (yes, literally) I stil find it highly enjoyable and I find myself anxious to find out what happens next. It is so well written that you are absorbed by the story and even though you know what will happen your feelings develop with the characters., Still my favorite book in the series. I am planning on re-reading them all on the beach this summer., BEAUTIFUL, Okay, this book was cool. I like how Harry Finallly started going out with Ginny. That was probably my favorite part, my least favorite part was when he left her. AND SHE LET HIM! Which I guess it\\'s better then her crying or something, but still just being like \"I knew this would happen\" was not my favorite response. Dumbledor dying would have been horrible if I had read the book when it first came out sadly, I didn\\'t, so I already knew about it and it wasn\\'t as horrible as when Cedric died. Actually the second time I read the book I cried., Check out my review of this brilliant book at http://adam-p-reviews.blogspot.co.uk/..., In some respects, I liked this book more than the previous one. For one thing, a lot of questions were answered, although not all of them. But I didn\\'t like how this one came to a close. The dark turn continues and not in a good way., I wasn\\'t much into Harry Potter when it first started - but picked up the first book on my way to Oregon on vacation (turned out not to be \\'vacationy\\' in any way - but that\\'s a whole other story) and quickly swept through 1-3 (maybe even four), seeking them out at bookstores and fred meyer\\'s along the way! I have never loved a series quite as much as I love the Harry series. JK has an amazing knack for pulling you into the book and removing you from this average world!! \\n Book 6 - While I waited with baited breath for this book, I wasn\\'t quite as impressed as I was with the first 5. It\\'s an excellent book in conjunction with book 7, but it feels unfinished and left me dying for the next part of the story. It\\'s still a great read, but make sure you have Deathly Hallows around to start right away., This series is considered an important part of me!, enjoy your imagination, penuh teka-teki but unfortunately...i haven\\'t finish to read it, Keep going! This book is a tear jerker, as some of them are in parts..., well,, it\\'s unpredictable story....., my favorite of harry\\'s adventures, Bringing in the used spells book was really cool. Even better when we found out in the end who owned it., This series inspired me to finish my book. If JK Rowling can do it, so can I., love it, I loved loved loved the 6th book! As much as I lovd the 3rd!, Snape, Snape, Snape... I failed to guess that!, This is one of my favorite of the series, didn\\'t want to stop reading., A lot of kissing, hell yeah..., #5 in my ranking of the Harry Potter books. Severely redeemed Book 5., The end of this was so shocking that I have yet to read the final one. I lost my passion for it with the loss of some of my favorite characters. \\n I\\'ll get to #7 eventually, really I will., I actually read this one last summer, after I finished part 7 (Deathly Hallows). I\\'m not a huge Harry Potter fan, but I\\'ve seen all the movies, and they were pretty good. I enjoyed the Deathly Hallows so much that I chose to read this one (part 6). It was very good. Easy to read as well, since it\\'s at more of a teenager\\'s level. If your a fan of the movies, you\\'ll enjoy it., Immediately following the 5th book I picked up the Half-Blood Prince and then went right into the Deathly Hollows. I loved all three of them. The sixth book does a wonderful job setting up the finale and did an excellent job of absorbing me into the world of Harry Potter., pretty awesome, and epic someone important dies who is killed by snape., The best of the series!!! Holy plot twist!, GAK BISA BERHENTI BACANYA SEBELUM TAMAT, just a re-read before the movie..., another amazing book by jk rowling!! *no suprise* so read this book and series and you will love it , i promise... well if you dont like them you r crazy and thats not my fault soo...JK!!! Anyway read all the books. DONT JUST WATCH THE MOVIES AND B LIKE THATS GOOB ENOUGH. READ THE BOOKS THEY R SO MUCH BETTER I KNOW THAT NOW!!!!!!, seru deh... tegang & menyedihkan.., Love the Book'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"viiXwGF66ryj","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["df_books = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(DIR, 'df_books.csv'))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rxF2eWkk6-a2","colab_type":"code","outputId":"ff2083a4-19af-42d5-92e7-b49880f84889","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1570950093986,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":888,"user":{"displayName":"Dong Zhang","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDxc9KkKDwlw8jzI8MwD3jRm-To_YSxA1sHxJkT7w=s64","userId":"02889893830397101089"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":221}},"source":["print(df_reviews.shape)\n","print(df_books.shape)\n","print(df_reviews.dtypes)\n","print(df_books.dtypes)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["(2080190, 2)\n","(276027, 6)\n","book_id         int64\n","review_text    object\n","dtype: object\n","average_rating    float64\n","book_id             int64\n","image_url          object\n","title              object\n","description        object\n","ratings_count       int64\n","dtype: object\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"lR7PbDzU7FG8","colab_type":"code","outputId":"6d8375af-8ecb-4ff6-f233-9b1921b4cad7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1570950116812,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1153,"user":{"displayName":"Dong Zhang","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDxc9KkKDwlw8jzI8MwD3jRm-To_YSxA1sHxJkT7w=s64","userId":"02889893830397101089"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":68}},"source":["df_reviews['review_text'] = df_reviews['review_text'].astype(str)\n","print(df_reviews.dtypes)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["book_id         int64\n","review_text    object\n","dtype: object\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0r62p31G7OuJ","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["result2 = df_reviews.merge(df_books, on='book_id', how='inner')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6bRbEJes7WwO","colab_type":"code","outputId":"7b3aca7d-0bca-4891-a005-24d4f5c6f5d1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1570950198568,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":959,"user":{"displayName":"Dong Zhang","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDxc9KkKDwlw8jzI8MwD3jRm-To_YSxA1sHxJkT7w=s64","userId":"02889893830397101089"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["result2.shape"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(275210, 7)"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"EOXnfcLi7rXr","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["df_reviews = result2\n","export_csv = df_reviews.to_csv (r'/content/gdrive/My Drive/Goodreads/data/df_reviews.csv', index = None, header=True)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_ak1OTNj0FXy","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["df_reviews_short = df_reviews[df_reviews.ratings_count > 1000] \n","df_reviews_short = df_reviews_short.sort_values(['ratings_count'], ascending=[False])"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LAXEbZDF2qJQ","colab_type":"code","outputId":"80464903-84a7-4ba2-f578-3660f2578fef","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1570950794236,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":858,"user":{"displayName":"Dong Zhang","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDxc9KkKDwlw8jzI8MwD3jRm-To_YSxA1sHxJkT7w=s64","userId":"02889893830397101089"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":991}},"source":["df_reviews_short.head(10)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>book_id</th>\n","      <th>review_text</th>\n","      <th>average_rating</th>\n","      <th>image_url</th>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <th>description</th>\n","      <th>ratings_count</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>61921</th>\n","      <td>2767052</td>\n","      <td>I cracked and finally picked this up.
