hogwarts dan sekitarnya saya pikir di umur segini beneran berasa tua bicara macam ini baca buku ini lagi bakal kehilangan gregetnya ternyata tidak masih tetap seru dan menyenangkan petualangan harry potter dan teman-temannya ini tidak sabar untuk kembali jatuh cinta di buku-buku berikutnya kalau kalau masih ada muggle atau mundane atau mortal atau apapun istilah yang cocok yang belum pernah mendengar nama harry potter dia adalah anak laki-laki yatim piatu yang besar bersama keluarga bibinya tadinya harry pikir dirinya hanya anak laki-laki biasa yang mungkin sedikit kurang beruntung karena kelurga bibinya ini sedikit tidak menyukai dirinya tapi kemudian hidup harry berubah saat suatu hari ia menerima surat undangan untuk masuk ke sebuah sekolah sihir kejutan ternyata harry potter adalah seorang penyihir dari situ cerita kita dimulai tentang dunia sihir tentang petualangan harry yang bukan lagi anak laki-laki biasa yup benar sekali kalau ini adalah buku anak-anak tapi buku anak-anak yang sama sekali tidak membosankan coba saja baca sendiri wink read brings tear eyes even funny part love book still magical first time freak star finally get around read feel like i am get

speech sniff love harry potter orignal creative amaze around spoiler alert para la mentes bien organizadas la muerte la siguiente gran aventura yo soy de esa generacion que crecio con los libros de harry potter si con las peliculas porque en ese tiempo yo ni en cuenta de que habia libros tenia el habito de leer muy marcado pero por fin que lo leido entendi muchas cosas que pesar de ver la pelicula muchas veces habia entendido lo queria wikipediar porque realmente queria leer el libro darle mi mente una version de los personajes tambien aunque conozco los personajes muy bien en la pelicula si hay una diferencia en el libro los siento ma vulnerables mas fuertes siento que ahora los conozco mejor tambien los imagine diferente los actores aunque si llegaban flashback se si esto un spoiler para quien haya leido el primer libro pero si lo hecho quiero quitarte esta magia de descubrimiento que yo sent puede que esto sea un spoiler para quienes lo hayan leido lo se pero prefiero advertir que lamentar say hay detalles que gustaron mucho como que harry le pasan ma cosas raras solamente se el incidente de dudley con la serpiente como cuando conoce malfoy ante de entrar hogwarts mientras elijen los uniformes tambien entendi por que hay tale pruebas cuando van buscar la piedra filosofal son encantamientos de parte de cada maestro de hecho hay do que se ven que corresponden quirrell snape el troll las botellas con acertijos respectivamente asi como saber de que forma voldemort llego la cabezota de quirrell hubo una momento de nostalgia bueno yo que soy toda sensibilidad la parte del espejo oesed en el libro solo sus padres tambien sus abuelos tios lo cual hizo sentir como harry mitad feliz mitad triste fue algo que impacto en cuanto los personajes como les decia los sent diferentes ahora se que piensa harry en todo momento lo cual para mi fascinante se hace muy noble valiente aunque tambien algo testarudo ron al principio muy enojado con hermione que en efecto realmente molesta pero luego se le pasa hay otros personajes que mencionan tanto alumnos como maestro que se ven en la pelicula snape siempre ha sido uno de mi personajes favoritos sino es que el primero pero en este libro se puede ver mucho de el solo como que su capa exterior dombledore su sentido del humor encantaron se hace muy tierno pero tambien enigmatico sabio gusta tambien que haya mas participacion de algunos personajes como percy el hermano de ron estoy realmente muy emocionada de seguir la saga le voy decir algo yo casi nunca escucho musica cuando leo menos de que sea instrumental tenga un ritmo muy fuerte sepa la letra porque distraigo pero mientras estaba leyendo di cuenta de los ritmos tan variados que escuchaba realmente enganche ya le agarre mucho carino espero despues leerlo en ingles lot modern teen book great honestly say i am glad harry potter phenomenon great pretty original fantasy series great plot surprisingly believable character fantastic

borjade jag kan inte minnas exakt nar det var som jag forsta gangen tog del av j.k.rowlings storslagna fantasydramatik men mitt forsta mote med trollkarlsvarlden var form av en ljudbok pa kassettband men nu har det blivit dag att aterigen stiga till den bokserie som kanske mer nagon annan varit kannetecknande min barndom och mycket haller fortfarande harry potter inledande berattelse varlden rowling bygger upp ar inget annat makalos och kanslan av att den har varlden existerar utanfor boken ar tydlig pa varenda blad av den nagot som blir extra anmarkningsvart ett aterbesok ar hur val rowling lagger ut ledtradar infor fortsattningen och det ar en benstark grundstomme hon ger varlden harry potter samtidigt ar det som inledning som harry potter och de vise sten fungerar allra bast sjalva boken sig ar inte felfri trot sina hundratals och ater hundratals sidor kanns berattelsen trot allt framstressad och det som rowling lyckas sa val med kommande bocker att bygga upp en kansla av skollovet pa hogwarts far har sta sidan nar boken hoppar fran ena viktiga storydetaljen till nasta utan allt mycket daremellan trot mina asikter om bokens allmanna kvaliteer finns inget som kan andra min granslosa karlek till den den ar starten pa nagot alldeles unikt och makalost och det kan jag inte vara den tacksam nog read style go read book series love really weird reason never add hp book

much sucker book involve magic wizard witch fly weird name thing creo que hay nada que pueda decir de este libro que se haya dicho ante siempre gustaron la peliculas las mirado decenas de veces sobre todo la primeras cada vez que tengo oportunidad las veo de nuevo esa la razon por la que tenia un poco de miedo leer los libros decepcionarme simplemente sentir que eran para mi poder terminarlos se mile de cosas pasaron por mi cabeza ante de leerlo queria que nada arruinara la peliculas estaba equivocada fui tonta al leerlos ante porque ame este libro encanto todo absolutamente todo ya conocia la historia parecia genial pero lo que ma gusto del libro que se sintio como un libro introductorio la saga que algo que pasa usualmente con los primeros libros de la series/sagas rowling creo este universo magico lleno de criaturas extranas lugares fantasticos magia decenas hechizos personajes historias que el lector tenia que conocer pero en ningun momento la lectura se hizo ma lenta por la explicaciones sino que todo fluia encanta que hay pequenos detalles en la historia que parecen tener importancia pero en el desenlace todo importa para resolver el misterio todo necesario necesario hablar de los personajes que son todos geniales creo que dumbledore fue uno de mi favoritos cuando en la peliculas habia llamado tanto la atencion eso fue curioso bueno tengo mucho ma que decir solo que espero continuar con la serie pronto harry potter series one much like countless others always adore recently re-reading millionth time decide love series read still love much last time gaaah read

virou uma especie de tradicao love fenomeno harry potter comeca de maneira bem modesta esse primeiro volume introduz personagens cenarios que agora fazem parte imaginario popular algo que ultrapassa propria literatura grande merito de j.k rowling foi ter criado um universo com mesmo apelo de outras criacoes passado mas com um toque contemporaneo sua obra soube conversar com jovens que deixaram seus videogames para ler essa retomada da leitura como algo ao mesmo tempo divertido formador da melhor literatura juvenil ma livro tem problemas com personagens estereotipados visao de mundo que reforca senso comum solucoes narrativas batidas apenas uma promessa que vira seguir na serie love book whole saga one favorites book ever think j.k rowling great author wonderful experience feel book

harry read amo este libro la saga completa uno de mi libros favoritos opino que j.k rowling es una gran autora es increible experimentar lo que sientes trave del libro nunca te aburres puedes dejar de leerlo aunque habla sobre magia hechiceria tambien te provee de mucho misterio porque quieres saber quien bueno quien malo quieres descubrir los secretros escritos en cada pagina puedes sentir lo que el personaje siente incluso cuando el ella el que cuenta la historia aquello bastante complicado al menos como yo lo veo va amar los tres personajes principales harry potter ronald weasley hermione granger son personajes muy real agradables odiaras otros personajes como draco malfoy lord voldemort hay algunos hermosas frases como es bueno dejarse arrastrar por los suenos olvidarse de vivir frase

cuenta que importa cuantas veces lo lea el sentimiento siempre el mismo ya que este un comentario un tanto nostalgico empezare diciendo que lo que ma gusto como siempre fue ron jamas entendere porque la peliculas fueron tan despectivas con el porque hilarante tiene un ingenio tan agudo una facilidad para aplacar la tension en el ambiente que logra sacarme sonrisas en cada aparicion por otro lado malfoy tan despreciablemente maligno que encanta harry potter la piedra filosofal por mucho mi favorito de la saga por su dulzura hay una inocencia patente en sus personajes asi como en las breve temblorosas lineas que construyen la historia rowling es una de la pocas escritoras que puede llegarle al lector sin la necesidad de escribir excelente sus personajes son todo lo que necesita el libro para brillar si hay un punto resaltante en este libro el primer encuentro que tenemos de ellos porque instantaneamente se imprimen en el corazon book amaze probably favorite book time finish fourth

nunca era el momento sinceramente daba miedo empezarlo porque crei que despues de haber visto las peliculas tantas veces se iba hacer aburrido pesado iba gustarme pf harry potter todo el mundo le gusta puede gustarte era demasiada presion pero finalmente el momento llego arrepiento muchiisimo de haberlo leido ante de que nadie en mi infancia dijera lee este libro mira esta pelicula porque si amaba las peliculas pero nunca acerque sus libros pero ahora con anitos lei el primer libro mejor tarde que nunca gusto fue muy entretenido ligero pero por que lo lei ante creo que le habria tomado ma carino habria gustado ma si lo hubiese leido de chica medida que iba leyendo daba cuenta de lo bien que habian hecho la pelicula una adaptacion muy fiel lo que la vez restaba algunos puntos porque ya sabia como iba seguir la historia solo hubieron un par de cositas nuevas algunas dudas resueltas tengo que ver la pelicula ante de leer el libro todavia queda pendiente decidir en que casa gustaria estar crei que despues de leerlo iba ser ma facil pero en el libro el tema de la casas practicamente gryffindor los buenos slytherin los malos hufflepuff relleno ravenclaw relleno asi que esta dificil estrellas casi encuentro nada que desagradara mucho pero sorry rowling aunque haya estado muy bien diferencia de muchos mi infancia fueron las peliculas de harry potter los libros le tengo un carino demasiado especial la peliculas aunque probablemente despues lo suba estrellas voy leer el resto de la saga por supuesto read book earlier knew would awesome somehow waited read book one weak yes find

powerful j.k rowling writes really well every age group enjoy type book series read never get bored escribiran libros sobre harry...todos los ninos del mundo conoceran su nombre primera lectura de abril arrepiento de haber leido el libro hasta ahora obviamente ya habia visto la peliculas muchisimas veces cada una conocia la historia pero como sucede en todas las adaptaciones de libros peliculas aquellas le faltan muchisimos detalles por lo cual decidi que ya habia llegado el momento de leerme los libros yo ya tenia mi opinion sobre algunas cosas de la historia pero al leer el libro algunas cambiaron muchas se integraron por ejemplo ron durante todo el tiempo que visto las peliculas de hp ron cayo mal siempre pense que era algo tonto que le daban demasiada importancia pero al leer el libro lo unico que queria era abrazar ron casi todos los personajes regalarle algo nuevo odio ver como se afligia con la cosas usadas que le pasaban de sus hermanos porque creia que nunca llegaria ser tan bueno como ellos al final termine teniendole carino al nino pelirrojo los gemelos weasley el humor las bromas de fred george son divertidisimas creo que haya alguien que se les pueda comparar molly weasley amo esta mujer desde que conoce harry es dulce amable cuando le mando el sweater en navidad casi se sale una lagrima ocupamos ma persona como ellas en el mundo creo que hasta ahora mi personaje favorito tambien durante la lectura cambio la manera en que veia la muerte de los papa de harry durante el tiempo en que mi punto de vista se basaba en lo que mostraba la pelicula la muerte de sus padre producia ningun sentimiento de apatia por su situacion pero con el libro llego un sentimiento enorme al igual que con ron habia veces en que solo queria abrazar harry decirle que todo iba estar bien que estaria con el en fin un gran libro que se queda marcado en tu corazon obviamente continuare con la saga i am little embarrassed admit take long pick series childhood year always

de harry potter siempre son bienvenidos pensaba que ya seria muy tarde para ponerme con ellos que el hecho de saber tanto sobre la saga sin haberme leido un solo libro perjudicaria pero disfrutado como un enano con cada parrafo del libro de admirar como una historia puede ser tan completa muchos puede llegarles parecer simple incluso para crios pero hay que valorar que la autora solo ha escrito una saga de libros sino que ha creado un universo totalmente nuevo un deporte que jamas se habria imaginado lo ma importante dota de un gran carisma los personajes adoro leer fred george siempre

zgode nezgode simpaticne ekipe carobnjaka carobnica hogwartsu najboljoj skoli carobnjastva prica je odlicna radnja dobro razvijena zanimljiva likovi jako dobro razradeni vjerujem da ne moram pisati

film tesko ga je promasiti jer zbilja ga cesto prikazuju drugih zamjerki nemam nije knjige posto je puno opsirnija od ekranizacije samim time zanimljivija zato osobitim nestrpljenjem cekam nastavke serijala koji ce redovito izlaziti pogotovo iz razloga jer srecom nisam pogledala ostale filmove pa jedva cekam procitati daljnje avanture harrya njegovog drustvanca bez ikakvih saznjanja daljnjoj radnji zbog cega vjerujem da ce svaka sljedeca knjiga biti jos interesantnija prepuna iznenadenja jednom kad svi nastavci izadu ne samo da cemo za malo novaca popuniti biblioteke ovim svevremenskim serijalom vec ce komplet ciniti odlican vrlo vrijedan poklon koji malo koga ne bi odusevio jako se veselim tome watch movie love decided read book pick detail may leave movie needless say book

bastante habia subestimado mucho esta saga gustan la peliculas si pero nunca pense en animarme leer los libros que la inspiraron empece con el audiobook que una buena amiga habia pasado dije porque si los voy leer pues los escucho sin embargo iba bien por el capitulo cuando descargue todos los libros puse leer el primero segun lo iba escuchando partir de ahi la trama atrapo totalmente algo que nunca crei posible ya que como sabemos son ninos de ano por dios les llevo toda una decada obstante sus personalidades cualidades aptitude que los definen han hecho apreciar cada uno de estos personajes identificandome mi misma con algunos de ellos durante esa edad enamorandome un poquito de cada uno en fin continuar leyendo el resto true example always read book watch film would believe

book childhood memory i have read seven time could remember word j.k rolling\\'s write make everything\\'s real appreciate way tell story ketika sesuatu yang ajaib terjadi dan sesuatu itu tidak bisa dijelaskan apa yang pertama membersit di benak kalian apakah kalian berpikir itu sihir lalu percayakah kalian kalau sihir bisa dipelajari dan ada sekolahnya--omong-omong nama sekolah itu hogwarts sayangnya sekolah itu agak pemilih dalam penerimaan siswanya hanya mau menerima siswa penyihir--iyalah namanya juga sekolah sihir setiap siswa yang punya bakat sihir akan mendapatkan surat dari hogwarst kira-kira bagaimana perasaan siswa yang mendapatkan surat itu inilah dia empat tokoh dari harry potter dan batu bertuah harry ron hermione dan draco nah apa kabar kalian semua harry spektakuler ron good hermione never well draco i am fine thank jadi apa yang pertama terlintas di pikiran kalian saat tahu mendapatkan surat dari hogwarts draco tidak ada jelas aku bakal masuk hogwarts orangtuaku mendaftarkanku sejak aku lahir hermione terkejut terkesima terpana tidak percaya sempat menganggapnya lelucon maksudku kedua orangtuaku muggle--omong-omong mereka dokter gigi siapa yang menyangka namaku terdaftar di sekolah sihir ron akhirnya tapi aku sempat deg-degan dan cemas fred dan george menakuti-nakuti mengenai te seleksi yang berat harry seandainya hagrid tidak menunjukkan sihir dan tidak sabar memberiku penjelasan aku akan mengganggap surat itu sebagai salah satu lelucon keluarga dursley bagaimana rasanya menginjakkan kaki untuk pertama kalinya di hogwarts draco lumayan bikin mual seseorang yang jadi legenda sesaat masuk ke asrama yang kurang bagus ron agak cemas takut tidak masuk gryffindor hermione hogwarts lebih menakjubkan dari yang aku baca di buku harry tak sabar ingin segera memulai pelajarannya sebelum guru-guru mulai suka memberi pr apa kejadian seru yang kalian alami di sana trio menyelamatkan batu bertuah kenapa batu bertuah mesti diselamatkan harry voldemort hendak mencurinya bukannya om voldie sudah mati harry belum dia masih hidup tapi dengan cara yang hina dan terkutuk jadi bagaimana dia bisa mencuri harry dia punya anak buah yang tak terpikirkan oleh kami bertiga emang kenapa om voldie pengen banget punya batu bertuah harry dia ingin bangkit lagi tentu saja ron batu bertuah itu juga bisa membuatnya kaya kok bisa hermione batu bertuah bisa digunakan untuk mengubah batu jadi emas dan bisa membuatkan pemiliknya cairan kehidupan yang bisa memperpanjang umur peminumnya batu bertuah merupakan salah satu pencapaian tertinggi ilmu alkimia ohh aku mengerti sekarang kita lanjut ke hal lie ada sesuatu yang agak menarik mengenai harry dan draco harry apa benar sebelum bertemu dengan dua sahabatmu kamu telah bertemu dengan draco sebelumnya dan draco yang terkenal sombong dan angkuh malah menyapa duluan agak lucu karena kalian malah menjadi musuh bebuyutan setelahnya draco saat itu aku belum tahu dia harry potter yang terkenal itu dan sebelum dia memilih sisi yang salah harry ya itu benar dan harry kamu sadar nggak seandainya hermione nggak pintar hampir di semua kelas kamu bisa jadi karakter yang sempurna harry lebih baik aku tidak menjawabnya draco kenapa potter takut orang-orang memberimu reputasi jelek ron tutup mulutmu malfoy draco kenapa weasley kau ehm satu pertanyaan terakhir untuk kalian semua menurut kalian kenapa semua orang baik sihir maupun non-sihir harus membaca memoar kalian draco harus tapi kalian mesti ingat yang kalian baca tentangku disana kebanyakan tidak ron salah draco hei ehm ehm hermione ron sambil menggelengkan kepala harry bacalah bila itu adalah pilihan kalian jangan membaca buku ini bila itu bukan pilihanmu kamu adalah pilihanmu hermione buku kami ini aman dibaca oleh semua umur bahasanya mudah dipahami tidak terlalu banyak diksi yang membuat pusing bahkan mungkin bisa jadi bacaan ringan ron ringan hermione menatap ron sekilas bacaan ringan di waktu senggang ron tidak semua umur hermione anak-anak yang belum paham kisah kita ini hermione orangtuanya bisa membacakannya sebagai dongeng pengantar tidur kebanyakan manusia biasanya suka sekali dengan kisah heroik draco batuk sangat menarik obrolanku bersama empat tokoh harry potter dan batu bertuah kita akan bertemu lagi minggu depan dan mengutip kalimat harry tadi harry ohh boleh saya menambahkan sedikit tentu harry seandainya aku tidak memilih mungkin aku bakal dimasukkan ke asrama slytherin kamu adalah pilihanmu kita adalah pilihan kita jangan takut untuk memilih ketimbang dipilihkan oleh orang lie saya f.j ismarianto dan inilah story eater tale p.s baru ketika aku baca ulang di usia sekarang aku menyadari hal yang luput saat membaca buku harry potter dan batu bertuah ini ketika aku masih duduk di bangku mt ternyata di buku ini tante jo memaksakan sifat beberapa tokohnya yang pal terasa adalah slytherin yang disebut licik ini pendapatku murni sebagai pembaca bukankah harusnya orang besar itu yang dingat adalah kebaikannya sementara tiga pendiri hogwarts dapat sifat baik kenapa slytherin nggak padahal ada kata yang bagus yang berkorelasi dengan licik cerdik atau lihai pembaca seolah digiring agar percaya kalau anak-anak dari slytherin ke semuanya jahat hingga sekarang aku masih penasaran dengan cara kerja tongkat sihir di dunia harry potter ini kata ollivanders tongkat memilih pemiliknya di buku dijelaskan tongkat sihir bisa setia pada pemiliknya yang baru bila dia memenangkan dalam pertempuran tapi di buku ini draco dibelikan tongkat oleh cissy ibunya dan ron dapat tongkat lungsuran dari george jelas tongkat kedua cowok itu bukan tongkat yang memilih pemiliknya mungkin hal ini terlupa penjelasannya oleh tante jo sama seperti asrama hufflepuff yang terlupakan

enough say harry potter philosopher\\'s stone el libro que da comienzo la saga de rowling la novela nos muestra harry potter un nino huerfano que vive con sus tios quien descubre al cumplir ano que un chico comun corriente sino un mago la autora nos introduce de manera acertada un mundo paralelo al nuestro los muggles se nota que realizo una gran investigacion sobre leyendas monstruos animales mitologicos la novela un rejunte de leyendas seres magicos todo esta perfectamente armado interconectado en este libro harry se hace amigo de ron hermione hagrid nos enteramos que harry tiene un gran enemigo lord voldemort se envuelto en una aventura para proteger la piedra filosofal que se encuentra escondida en el edificio del colegio hogwarts de magia hechiceria parece un libro recomendable para iniciar los ninos en la lectura de hecho gracias esta serie de libros muchos chico que normalmente leian comenzaron leer luego al crecer siguieron leyendo se acercaron libros que se pueden considerar serios tambien gusta como escribe rowling como maneja el suspenso desde el primer capitulo quede enganchada con la historia resena publicada en mi blog http://soldeechesortu.blogspot.com.ar

tenia miedo de que decepcionara cuando lo hiciera pero estamos ante j.k rowling ella nunca decepciona sacando de lado el hecho de que ya conocia la historia decir lo que iba pasar entere de un monton de hechos que desconocia cosas increibles datos super curiosos verdaderamente ame este libro puede esperar seguir leyendo esta saga le di porque al principio molesto un poquito ya saber la historia tarde un poco ma de lo que esperaba en engancharme pero si todavia leyeron la saga estan con la mismas reticencias que yo pues dejenlas de lado porque esta es una de esas obras maestras que marcan la literatura para siempre great start series uiteraard gewoon fantastisch zit zoveel meer dan de film wish would start series year ago absolutely love book i am glad finally read glad do spoiler alert i am sure many think crazy three star instead five though consider four reason remain succinct decide agree house cup really point book i am sure would say yet development story predominant feature

fantastic add magic book muy amena la lectura un libro corto entretenido il primo libro confronto ai seguiti acerbo abbastanza logico dato che il piu vecchio lo stile della rowling si evoluto negli anni non voglio dire che un libro brutto mediocre conti fatti la prima parte una semplice introduzione al mondo magico per carita per niente spiacevole se ami immergerti scenari fantastici la trama sempre nella prima parte parecchio carente si risolleva nel finale con degli interessanti colpi di scena come sempre personaggi sono fantastici sono il vero punto di forza del libro ho adorato anche la parte dello specchio delle brame come dice silente non serve niente rifugiarsi nei sogni dimenticarsi di vivere conclusione una buona lettura per tutti consiglio ai nuovi lettori di continuare

la saga mete de lleno en el mundo magico de harry potter atrayendo desde el principio la aventura de harry ron hermione mantiene enganchado hasta el final encanto el libro la primera vez que lo lei lo disfruto muchisimo cada vez que lo releo importan los anos que pasen una de la cosas que ma maravillan solo de este libro sino de la saga completa el mundo magico que rowling ha creado coherente con el mundo real con gran detalle complejidad ademas muy interesante da ganas de entrar en el libro para explorar ma por tu cuenta en este primer libro se nos presenta por primera vez de una forma amena totalmente verosimil la trama en este libro empieza termina en el una trama sencilla pero la vez muy solida en la que se vislumbra la profundidad de una historia un mundo que abarcan ma alla de lo que se vive en esas paginas ademas una trama de libro de aventuras en la que el lector va encontrandose con intrigas con respuestas hasta que se comprende lo que estaba sucediendo en hogwarts quien estaba detras al final tiene una parte muy entretenida en la que los tres amigos se enfrentan una serie de pruebas siendo estas el colofon de esta novela de aventuras magicas solo un libro entretenido sobre las aventuras de un nino mago en un mundo muy interesante tambien habla del amor que protege incluso cuando quien nos lo otorgaba se encuentra con nosotros habla de la amistad verdadera de que una sabelotodo puede llegar ser una gran amiga de que el ma patoso cobarde de la clase tambien puede encontrar valor para enfrentar sus miedos habla de defender nuestros principios en lugar de dejarnos atraer por lo facil negativo un libro con varias muy buenas segundas lecturas ahi donde en mi opinion radica su valor de la saga enteron en realidad el lector vive una aventura con momentos realmente divertidos mientras al mismo tiempo esta viviendo una historia de gran profundidad que permite reflexionar i am read first time could put book love harry potter cannot wait read matter many time

review kind want ramble thing notice read young blog post actual review little bit worried age year since read harry potter sorcerer\\'s stone first time lot fondness series would base nostalgia rather actually still find enjoyable even magical read recent history enjoy book target toward young audience cannot tell happy realize least magic definitely still nostalgia course play part magic something part pretty much half life pretty hardcore fangirl upon time think even pick first time would still find great book thing actually bother though never notice demonization group child discrimination huge theme series think get call enough much discrimination kid slytherin go obviously slytherins grow actually death eater aka terrible people deserve shit receive kid know point many time dumbledore take house cup away slytherins end sorcerer\\'s stone unfair that is true pretty bullshit something notice watch movie back read book notice somewhat deep problem something come really

victory snatch away last minute reach logic headmaster parent i would piss get see gryffindors cheer hufflepuff ravenclaw cheer well solely fact slytherin child house case family accuse childhood evil lesser conspire dark magic discriminate something really control odds voldemort return someone like malfoy join death eater yes golden trio reward prevent return dark lord whose goal little slaughtering people saw lesser much ask reward way create victim think hermione crazy comment believe book i am certain exactly concepts house even house quidditch team promote division rather unity young understand right draco malfoy bully snooty little brat character punish book kind hold snape standard slytherins punishes equally see handful behave poorly paradoxically though persecution slytherins mistaken study do show people read harry potter kid grown people see harm persecution discrimination also think interest jk rowling one liberal-minded accept people see type person would judge whole group people base poor decision perhaps know jk rowling least social medium evidence suggest fake stance online popularity realize try move away series go series go move little away stark black white view world add nuance snape malfoy give shade gray character voldemort give motive evil oppose evil sake evil book actually begin exploration harmfulness persecution hermione second book

review atat de greu sa descrii carte pe care iubesti cu atat mai greu cu cat harry potter si piatra filosofala este cartea care m-a impins pe usa pe care scria bookaholic devenire tratament innexistent sunt mai bine de ani de cand citit prima data acest volum dar de atunci l-am deschis rasfoit si recitit de peste de ori primul exemplar din biblioteca mea primit dar de la teo prietena mea cea mai buna pe vremea cand aveam ani aproape s-a dezintegrat este plin de banda adeziva dar il pastrez asa si il pretuiesc indiferent de starea care se afla de curand reusit sa pun gherutele pe noua stralucitoarea si cartonata varianta harry potter cea aparuta la editura arthur cu sprijinul prietenilor nostri de la libraria online libris ciuda miilor de comentarii negative pe care le-am citit pe net despre aceasta editie incercat sa primesc cu inima deschisa pentru ca povestea nu s-a modificat cu nimic asa cum era si normal ci avem parte doar de noua traducere il cunoastem pe acelasi harry pragul varstei de ani care locuieste cu unchiul matusa si varul sau asta pana primeste scrisoare care este invitat sa studieze la hogwarts scoala de farmece si vrajitorii echipat cu cele necesare pentru noua scoala harry se urca expresul de hogwarts fara sa stie ca de acolo va incepe marea aventura vietii lui cea care se va descoperi pe sine isi va face prieteni de nadejde dar va invata si multe lucuri uimitoare despre lumea magica din care face parte aceasta noua traducere aduce cateva mici modificari ale termenilor folositi fiind unul dintre fanii care crescut odata cu aceasta serie si care stie pe dinafara citate si replici din ea simtit la inceput un mic disconfort de exemplu denumirea de incuiat folosita de vrajitori atunci cand vorbesc despre persoana fara puteri magice fost schimbata traducerea cuvantului muggle folosit de autoare textul original si devenit mageamiu vajhat rama pur si simplu quidditch adica varianta originala cuvantului aleea diagon este acum aleea tor un joc de cuvinte potrivit pe care l-am apreciat si chiar m-a amuzat pentru veterani consider ca aceasta editie merita adaugata la colectia harry potter noilor veniti nu pot decat sa le-o recomand cu caldura pentru ca este cea mai buna serie pe care citit-o lectura placuta si sa aveti intotdeauna bagheta la indemana pericolul pandeste la fiecare colt prin merika khronia mou elege kaneis oti tha

read jk rowling let us face know what is store even write genre well character fully develop even begin write well good whole series must must read gotta start begin esta resena tambien puedes encontrarla en soy gente de libros creo que deje la varita en la lechuceria terminado de leer leido para el read challenge libro situado en europa leido para el bingo literario libro que inicia una saga esto va de cuando una esta de lo ma contenta porque al fin al fin leyo harry potter la piedra filosofal te pasa una potterhead se escribir el termino sin tener que verificarlo eh eh te hace pasar un momento dicaprio/gaga embarrasing aprovecho para quitar poner en una resena el gif de leo/gaga de mi lista de pendientes que la cosa fue asi estaba yo de lo ma happy en mi cola bachaquera cola que se hace en venezuela para entrar un supermercado para comprar productos de primera necesidad tambien se conoce como bachaqueo la compra arbitraria de productos de primera necesidad para luego venderlos de forma independiente al triple de su precio los estoy venezolanizando eh bue que precisamente happy porque estuviese bachaqueando sino porque despues de quince dia de lectura demasiado continuum que tome mi tiempo pse habia terminado harry potter la piedra filosofal regodeaba en mi misma por la hazana cuando por al lado pasa una chica cuyo telefono movil repicaba con la melodia que acompana como banda sonora las peliculas de harry potter imaginaran mi verguenza decir yo toda ducha con mi primer libro de harry potter leido cuando una potterhead lleva jarri hasta en el movil por suerte humille ma mi misma llevando el libro como tenia pensado la cola bachaquera para quienes se lo pregunten la repuesta obtuve puntos de consolacion por reconocer la melodia de jarri necesito ponerle un dumbledore mi vida que regale puntos arbitrariamente en fin que ya entrando en materia puedo sino senalar que alguien como yo quejosa morir-ojssdjjhdfqupwaduqhfqwenbhrfbfjewh debido falla tecnicas hago inciso carraspea okay sorry por eso que con el quejosa morir trata de reir entro una crisis de carcajadas fea muy fea porque recordo un fic de star war que estoy leyendo en una situacion un personaje le dice otro algo como blah blah blah fuck death sea te la cogiste morir quejosa morir se que probablemente vean la conexion sin contexto le encuentren gracia que bueno mi sentido del humor carece de la sofisticacion que seguramente muchos de mi distinguidos compis lectores poseen porque bueno yo soy como cosmo de los padrinos magicos que dicen mani rio pero tenganme paciencia si ahora si retomando el tema ven como divago le decia que alguien quejosa morir trata de reir deberia leer libros porque siendo objetivos el de mi resenas por decir el yo quejandome de lo que gusto del libro que maldita sea calypk deja de quejarte disfruta el fuckin libro pero tan indiscutible como el genio creativo de la rowling mi quejosidad en el caso presente iba ser menos pesar de que guste eldramionehacelatirmikokoro continuacion expondre cada una de la cuestiones que han hecho que este libro tan cargado de brillante magnifica creatividad obtenga una nota perfecta gooo dejar huerfanos en la puerta ya precisamente mainstream pero la rowling de la vieja escuela esa misma escuela donde estudiaron todos los escritores mexicano de telenovelas la de la maria especificamente maria la del barrio marimar marichuy esto pudo ma que ella ni hablar jarri lo dejamos la intemperie en la madrugada bueno vamos dejarle una cartita que explique el redundante hecho de quien de que sus padre estan muertos joder que siendo jarri la celebridad que podian al menos entregarlo en persona en vez de dejarlo eldramionehacelatirmikokoro tirado cual paquete de mensajeria ojo que en mi pais existen los buzones los paquetes te los entregan en persona quesesepa pero habia que hacerlo la antiguita llamenme visionaria por esperar lo contrario por que le encargan cosas importantes hagrid en serio tan simple como si yo le diera mi hermano menor que un joven con retardo mental severo que hasta para caminar necesita ayuda uno de mi libros esperara que lo leyera mean really se trata de inteligencia de si la tienes sino de si esta en tus capacidades trust hagrid tiene ese tipo de capacidades tambien esta la cosa que todos tenemos capacidades/habilidades distintas hagrid se le dan bien la bestias lo del perro de tres cabezas bueno eso si tiene sentido pero lo de mandarlo buscar eldramionehacelatirmikokoro la piedra tanto sin embargo ya vimos como termino todo con lo del huevo de dragon el hablando demas bajo los efectos etilicos como entere de que andas con un huffie te desheredo lucius malfoy su hijo mientras le da de comer los pavo entiendo que la idea de la casas sea promover la camaraderia la excelencia mediante la sana competencia pero lo que entiendo el elitismo de mierda que se cargan con su si va slytherin eldramionehacelatirmikokoro eres un mago tenebroso si va hufflepuff vale ni para una deposicion gryffindor la onda ravenclaw territorio neutral ona rowling si esta escribiendo un libro para ninos criaturas altamente impresionables que absorben todo como los va llenar de prejuicios acerca de con quien esta bien sentarse la hora de la comida hablando de prejuicios en mi humilde opinion quedan muy bien retratados bajo la pluma de rowling lo aplaudiria si solo quedaran en el mundo infantil porque en su mayoria dichos prejuicios son eso infantiles pero la cosa va ma alla en todo el libro tienes que tragarte un tufillo de prejuicioso moralista de eldramionehacelatirmikokoro hacer lo correcto de mirar mal al que que resulto francamente insoportable sentia que dieran opciones oportunidades sentia que la rowling decia que tenia que ser una ratita prejuiciosa de aire altamente moralista pues por ejemplo entiendo como que jarri se decide ser amigo de ron cuando el susodicho tan desagradable como draco malfoy mismo la unica diferencia que percibo entre ese par aparte del color de pelo que uno desagradablemente pobre el otro desagradablemente rico eso que yo siempre tiendo empatizar con el pobre pse porque soy pobre pero ronald weasley la dicotomia del bien el mal pero quejeso ona rowling siguiendo la linea moralista esa hermana fea que le pichamos al amigo de nuestro novio gusta esa linea divisoria entre ser tenebroso que existen puntos intermedios falta mucho gris para el caso eldramionehacelatirmikokoro el resto de los colores del espectro hizo gracia en lo particular que por ser buenos los gryffindor hayan ganado la copa de la casas porque la traduccion al monton de puntos que entrega dumbledore al final de forma tan vil descarada esa sea realidad donde estas pa que le metas un zape dumbledore rowling por esto en que mundo vive esta gente cuando en la vida se gana algo por ser bueno refiero ser bueno en el sentido de destacar en algo sino hacer el bien con esto refiero especificamente al alto sentido de justicia para hacer lo correcto evitar que voldemort consiga eldramionehacelatirmikokoro la piedra filosofal que jarri tiene ir enfrentarse el cuando un nino estudiante de primer ano que ha vivido toda su vida hasta hace unos me como muggle criatura ademas que ha llevado una vida de vejaciones que ha tenido quien se ocupe apropiadamente de el le explique el sentido del honor algo parecido pero claro como jarri el bueno jarri tiene pesar de sus carencias obvias un alto sentido para hacer lo correcto aunque sea estupido mortalmente peligroso despues de todo yolo querian probar que los estudiantes de primer ano eran unos genios que sus profesores director son muy estupidos porque de otra forma explico como unos ninos cualequieras van resolver los acertijos de sus profesores disenados por magos capaces con experiencia de sobra para evitar que alguien que se metio robar en gringotts se metiera robar eldramionehacelatirmikokoro en hogwarts solo eso que la persona que queria robar la piedra filosofal tuviera que pasar por tanto para hacerlo sobornar al guardabosques con un huevo de dragon cuando para los ninos superar la pruebas fue como un paseo en los prados le dire porque la pruebas estaban disenadas para que jarri estudiante de primer ano la pudiera superar porque segun mi teorias conspiratorias dumbledore queria que jarri se enfrentara voldemort un muchachito huerfano venido menos sin mayor talento que el de romper la reglas estar siempre en el lugar equivocado ademas de una fama arrolladora ma grande que su propia sombra aqui mi razon para odiar dumbledore ese maldito viejito se la hace pasar de noble bufon cuando en realidad una mente perversa que usa un nino como carne de canon importa mucho el acto en si porque estrategia pero molesta que lo endiosen tanto que dieran como si fuese el jesucristo cuando el anciano ma bien un lord satan por la barbas de merlin que ese viejito un lord voldemort solo que del lado contrario del tablero por que nadie se da cuenta respira ya calmo que ya hay que ir terminando con esto oh wait si faltaba quejarme de algo ma nada ma nada menos senora senor le quidditch por que lo odio tiene nada que ver con que se den fatal los deport porque es un juego de uno que la rowling disfrazo como un juego en equipo con el unico proposito de darle ma fama gloria al pobre huerfano de jarri que nunca ha sido bueno en nada oh ternurita porque si como el futbol en escobas pera que cono necesitan un buscador decir que hace el buscador sobrevolar evitar que lo tiren de la escoba mientras espera que aparezca la snitch la cual coincidencialmente lo que vale ma lo que termina el juego diganme que equipo hay en eso porque yo veo ma que eldramionehacelatirmikokoro una oportunidad demasiado obvia de ser el heroe del dia nada ma como si la rowling quiso darle todo de lo que carecio jarri en un ano de curso escolar como si la cosas funcionaran asi cofcof privilegios cofcof denle de una vez el trono de hierro pse ya ahora si dejo de quejarme lo bueno diria que el genio creativo de la rowling pero eso demasiado obvio ademas que lo que ma gusto fue de hecho minerva mcgonagall esa senora que le quita puntos su propia casa que se envara cuando dumbledore decide dejar tirado jarri con sus tios muggle para mi el unico personaje con sentido en el libro lo malo mucho prejuicio lo feo dumbledore p.s eldramionehacelatirmikokoro cancion para este libro hedwig\\'s theme de la banda sonora de harry potter la piedra filosofal por john williams tiene su propio tema asi que que ma sino one happiest

membeli buku ini adalah karena rasa penasaran akibat berita-berita di tv dan koran bahwa di luar negeri orang-orang sedang demam harry potter jadilah saya serasa berjudi dengan ikut-ikutan membeli buku ini di toko buku terdekat di bagian awal-awal saya agak terheran-heran dengan selera humor j.k rowling bayangkan saja seorang anak umur tahun yang selalu dikucilkan oleh bibi paman dan sepupunya dengan sinisnya bahkan mendapat kamar sempit di bawah tangga semuanya itu diceritakan dengan kesan seolah-olah hal itu malah menjadi sesuatu yang lucu sarcastic humor selera humor yang aneh untuk ukuran selera orang indonesia menurut saya namun saya sangat tergelitik dengan ide j.k rowling yang menyebutkan kau-tahu-siapa untuk lord voldemort tetapi di luar itu buku pertama harry potter ini benar-benar sukses menyihir saya untuk melahap halaman demi halaman hingga tak terasa saya sudah tuntas membacanya dalam sehari di kelas pun saat itu saya masih kelas sma tiba-tiba banyak yang ingin meminjam buku itu saat mengetahui saya memiliki buku ini sialnya buku harry potter cetakan pertama saya ini sekarang hilang terbawa teman sma saya sekilas seperti menyicipi makanan yang manis hingga meleleh di lidah dan membuat anda ingin merasakan porsi keduanya one word amazing begin would like say whenever movie come watch book hand one time read harry potter great yes first book enough happy

merawatnya tidak memperlakukan harry dengan baik harry diberi kamar kecil berupa lemari di bawah tangga sering menjadi korban kejahilan dudley sepupu harry yang super gendut serta hukuman dari paman dan bibinya karena hal aneh sering terjadi seperti rambut harry yang tumbuh sendiri atau berbicara dengan ular di kebun binatang semua itu berubah saat harry menerima surat yang diantarkan burung hantu dari sekolah sihir hogwarts dan membuka identitas asli harry yang ternyata seorang penyihir komunitas penyihir menyebutnya anak yang bertahan hidup karena berhasil mengalahkan lord voldemort penyihir jahat yang membunuh orangtuanya tahun pertama harry di hogwarts diisi berbagai pelajaran menarik seperti mantra dan ramuan olahraga quidditch dimana harry bermain sebagai seeker dan bermain dengan sahabat barunya ron weasley dan hermione granger berbagai kejadian aneh akhirnya membawa harry berhadapan dengan musuh besarnya lord voldemort ini adalah seri pertama kisah harry potter dan mengantarkan jk rowling meraih popularitas sebagai wanita terkaya di inggris buku ini seperti mendobrak yang ada mengenai buku anak sebagai buku anak buku ini lebih tebal dengan cerita yang lebih kompleks dibandingkan buku sejenis dibandingkan buku karangan roald dahl misalnya melalui tangan dingin rowling buku anak yang tebal ini dikemas secara menyenangkan sekaligus mengibur pembacanya buku ini pun memperkenalkan dunia sihir harry potter yang kelak sangat populer diantara fansnya seperti muggle ataupun sihir yang diucapkan tokohnya buku ini juga menjaring banyak fan tidak hanya tokoh

get much time spend impressed character endear strike overall message good evil power love read memory grade sebenarnya saya lebih suka membaca novel terlebih dahulu daripada nonton filmnya.kalau ditanya bagus mana film dengan novelnya saya akan jujur jawab filmnya ketika saya mulai membaca novelnya saya akan membayangkan ketegangan kengerian kemisteriusan tapi saya tidak dapat ketiganya mungkin kemisteriusannya jadi hilang karena saya sudah tonton filmnya lebih dahulu tapi ketegangan dan kengeriannya harusnya nggak terlalu pengaruh.mungkin karena detailnya kurang sebenanya harapan saya adalah novel ini lebih bagus dari filnya tapi saya lebih suka filmnya.ada beberapa tambahan di film yang memuat tegang tapi tidak di sini seperti ketika kunci-kunci di ruangan bawah tanah yang terbang itu berburu harry dkk tapi di novel mereka lebih mudah menakhlukkannya sejujurnya saya agak aneh di bagian awal.meski saya orang yang suka berimajinasi tapi membayangkan motor besar terbang lampu yang tiba-tiba mati karena cahayanya diambil dan semacam itu sepertinya membutuhkan imajinasi yang lebih.hahaha saya pal suka ketika bagian lee jordan berkomentar tentang slitheryn ketika permainan quiditch dan endingnya karena buat saya tertawa dan tersenyum harry potter series literally change life start read book i am still love j.k rowling ability transform world magic age book

good well movie good una pena que estos libros salieran cuando yo era bebe desde que tengo do ano que veo la peliculas de harry potter cuando entere de que estas eran libros ya era tarde hubiera encantado poder leer los libros de esta saga cuando era chica que tanto gustaba leer encontraba por que empezar ahora que termino el libro da tanta pena saberme toda la historia de memoria de la tantas veces que vi la peliculas cuando era pequena la autora tiene una manera increible de narrar una manera pesada ni nada sino que siempre va al punto le da vueltas la cosa creo que por eso gusto tanto poder leerlo los personajes encantaron gusto ver que algunos eran tan parecidos como los mostraban en la peliculas tambien gusto poder ver las cosas desde el punto de vista de harry enterarme de cosas insignificantes de su vida que la vez eran importantes asombrosas cuando tenia do ano habia enamorado del harry potter de la peliculas si mis siete hubiera empezado leer los libros habria enamorado aun ma reviviendo mi amor hacia harry ron hermione ahora comprendo porque estos libros son tan especiales para las persona es por su trama que por cierto asombrosa sino por sus personajes por la manera de ser estos por el poder de la amistad del amor quiero los demas libros ya awesome ever would give six star possible give i have read book three time love every time j.k rowling

harry potter tahun pertama ini boleh dibilang epic bangaat btw di indonesia judulnya jadi harry potter sorcerer\\'s stone nih j.k rowling bisa banget ngebawa pembaca masuk ke dunia sihir ini sendiri buku pertama serial harpot ini bener-bener ngebikin gue yang notabene dulu masih sd jadi tergila-gila dengan novel dan melupakan komik untuk sementara alur yang disusun si rowling dengan sendirinya mengembangkan fantasi dan imajinasi gw sebagai anak kecil uwoh mwah untuk mbaknya baca rowling-yang sebelumnya gw pikir si rowling ini hihi buku pertama menceritakan harry yang tinggal di keluarga dursley dan ternyata he is ordinary boy kedatangan surat-surat yang tiba-tiba akhirnya membuka rahasia siapa harry sebenarnya padahal selama ini kenyataan bahwa harry seorang penyihir tidak pernah diungkit sekalipun dalam rumah keluarga dursley yang menyenangkan dalam buku ini adalah kebingungan harry memasuki dunia sihir yang belum pernah sekalipun ia sentuh dari lahir tapi jadi orang pal eksis di seantero dunia persihiran gawd jadi di buku ini gue dan harry berasa diperkenalkan oleh si rowling mengenai seluk beluk dunia sihir imajinasi j.k rowling bisa dibilang wow banget dan detail sekali kenapa karena bayangin deh sampe gw ikutan ngiler pengen banget nyobain kacang segala rasa bertie bott ikutan amaze sama foto yang orang di dalemnya bisa bergerak dan apapun itu bikin gw kagum sm imajinasi rowling seperti dimanapun apapun itu dalam serial buku pertama selalu berisi pengenalan tokoh dan sekali lagi rowling sangat detail dalam penggambaran tokoh dalam harry potter sukaaa anyway telat bangat dah yah bikin ni review filmnya aja uda sampe ketujuh alias udah tamat secara sd duluu banget tahun udah tahun yang lalu dan belum akrab sama internet sekian dah yah enjoy book guy

loathe harry potter\\'s uncle vernon aunt ketertarikan saya akan buku ini dimulai dari filmnya kebalikan dari kebanyakan orang tapi jk rowling sangat cerdas membuat alur yang tidak pernah bosan untuk dinikmati bahkan sampai sekarang bagaimana kehidupan anak yatim piatu yang tidak pernah bahagia bagaimana dia berubah dari bukan apa-apa menjadi apa-apa bagaimana kerinduan akan orang tua yang sudah tiada terus menghantui kehidupannya selanjutnya dan kejadian di masa lalu yang banyak mempengaruhi kehidupan di masa akan datang selain alur yang menarik anda akan terkesima bagaimana banyak detil yang sepertinya tidak penting ternyata akan menjadi kunci untuk cerita di seri selanjutnya misalnya mengapa jari kaki scrabbers tikus ron weasley hilang satu ternyata merupakan petunjuk penting untuk cerita di seri ketiga novel ini jk rowling dengan harry potter merupakan penulis favorit saya yang utama first experience mr potter..hehehhe..impressing ok know i am set hate mail please read closely

excellent characterization easy read re-reading buku ini saya baca ketika masih smp kira-kira tahun yang lalu dan saya membaca ulang minggu kemaren ini adalah buku sihir pertama yang saya baca dulu dan merupakan buku yang sangat berkesan bagi saya penjabaran karakternya sangat jelas dan pemilihan diksinya juga bagus selain itu buku ini penuh kejutan mantra-mantra dan benda-benda yang aneh yang di dunia nyata tidak akan pernah ada saya sangat menyukai karakter hermione granger disini dia digambarkan sebagai seorang gadis yang cerdas dan tahu segalanya saya juga sangat menyukai bagian dari penggambaran hongwarts oleh j.k rowling hal tersebut membuat saya seolah-olah saya berada di tempat tersebut bahkan saya sampai menghayal jika seandainya hongwarts dan sihir itu ada di dunia nyata ha ha buku harry potter ini memang benar-benar membuat kita berimajinasi mengenai dunia sihir ada gak sihir didunia ini kalau ada mau dong saya jadi penyihir ya seperti itulah walaupun awalnya saya agak sedikit bingung karna membaca novel harpot ini dalam versi inggris dan kemudian saya baca dalam versi indonesia sehingga saya benar-benar memahami review yang sangat telat harusnya tahun yang lalu
